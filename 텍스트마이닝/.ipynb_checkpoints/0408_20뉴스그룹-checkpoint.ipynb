[Would I kid you?]\\n\\n\\nDoes one man\\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\\ntheir original expression.\\n\\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \\nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

       "  ': \\n: I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with\\n: the extended cab.  Any opinions about these vehicles?  Have there been\\n: any significant problems?\\n: \\n: -- \\n: Dick Grady           Salem, NH,  USA            grady@world.std.com\\n: So many newsgroups, so little time!\\n\\n\\nI bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last\\nMay.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes\\nthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet\\nmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \\nsays that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"\\n\\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\"\\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \\nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\\n\\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What\\nreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt\\nto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for \\nthem to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new\\nFord F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never\\nbuy another Chevrolet.',\n",

       "  '[ . . .]\\n\\nI am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you\\nphrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of \"right\"\\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\\nof the position.\\n\\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold\\ndifferent moral values (feelings).',\n",

       "  '\\nA word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable\\nlocks under the Kryptonite name.\\n\\nWhen I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite \\nU-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for\\na new lock for the bicycle.\\n\\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\\n\\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\\'t even approach Kryptonite standards of\\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\\n\\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\\ndon\\'t know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\\n\\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \\ndark.  I didn\\'t try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \\nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\\nattack.\\n\\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \\ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).

       "  \"completed\\n\\nWhy would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more\\nsounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't\\nbe using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds\\nto play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to\\nthe channel also to let you know when the channel is getting\\nempty. Before it gets empty.\\n\\n7.1,\\n\\nCallbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even\\nunder System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with\\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\\n\\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\\ncan too.\\n\\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right.

       "  \"SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL\\n \\n    By Laura Pitter\\n    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist\\nwhen he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim\\ntown of Srebrenica last August.\\n    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody\\nwar, he considers himself a surgeon.\\n    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no\\nlicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives\\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\\nsections.\\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\\npatients.\\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\\nthe dead were women and children.\\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\\nheads.''\\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\\nbecause it increased bleeding.\\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\\n    Then the hunger set in.\\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\\nI left. And I cried too.''\\n\",\n",

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position\\nsomewhat disheartening.\\n\\nI understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I\\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\\nturn into no position at all?\\n\\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\\n\\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \\nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\\nLenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!\\n\\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\\narena acknowledges it as valid.\\n\\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\\nschools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a\\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\\nmoral and ethical decisions.\\n\\nWhat do you think? \\n\\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\\nname.)\\n\\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don\\'t have the kinds\\nof morals I want taught.

       "  \"[discussing the use of IRQ 7]\\n\\n\\n\\nTo put it a little differently:\\n\\n - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the\\n   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.\\n\\n - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's\\n   time to send out another byte to the printer.\\n\\n - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\\n   in the high-impedence mode.\\n\\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \\n   disconnected by a jumper.\\n\\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true\\n   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and\\n   that certainly isn't a requirement.)\\n\\n - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the\\n   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance\\n   reasons.  \\n\\nAnd the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.\",\n",

The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.

As this discharge takes place two things\\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\\n\\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\\n\\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with\\nthese products for a newer battery.\\n\\n[stuff deleted]\\n[stuff deleted]\\n\\nThis stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.\\nIn fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher\\ntemperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\\n\"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\\n -50 to \\'pull\\' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at\\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\\nnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm\\nthe battery.\\n\\n(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge\\n to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any\\n such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This\\n is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool\\n during storage.)',\n",

       "  '\\nA question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a\\nphilosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything\\nevil done in its name?  You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

You\\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \\nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\\n  reduce demand.\\n\\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\\n  at the expense of the individual.\\n\\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvailable from:\\n  Cato Institute\\n  224 Second Street SE\\n  Washington, DC  20003\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        The Cato Institute\\n\\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \\n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\\n    The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets\\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\\n  of the American Revolution.\\n    Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually\\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary\\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\\n  civil liberties.\\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\\n  no government funding.

As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn\\'t say that the people\\nare tormented forever.\\n\\nPsalm 9:17:  I don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.',\n",

If it were done with a group encryption scheme\\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\\ncan be recovered are lessened.\\n\\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\\n\\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\\n\\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \\ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\\nenforcement block).

To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\\'s version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.  It\\'s the divine Logos that is eternal.',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nActually the reasons you don\\'t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are\\n1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than\\nnuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many\\nfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can\\'t harm anything, let \\'em go.\").  \\n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\\n\\n\\n\\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\\npressure.\\n\\n\\nTrue.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \\nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\\nthe costs of impure water.

       "  'Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.\\n\\n[I\\'m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most\\nof our readers probably haven\\'t seen it.  --clh]\\n\\nChrist warns that anyone who \"breaks one of the least of these\\ncommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in\\nthe kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I\\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\\npartisan theology.\\n\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.',\n",

       "  'Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\\n\\nSeveral problems:\\n\\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\\n   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\\n   VRAM.\\n\\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\\n\\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\\n      be.\\n\\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\\n\\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\\n\\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\\n   \"R\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn\\'t have to do this.\\n\\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\\n   the VGA mode.\\n   \\n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\\n\\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).\\n',\n",

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.

Furthermore, the Church\\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \\nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\\nwithout that grace can\\'t be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\\nthem to become saints.

Thus, they were\\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n\\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\\nfor those He can\\'t bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

The Administration is \\nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \\ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \\non its government's commitment to reform.\\n\\n\\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\\n\\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \\ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \\nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \\nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \\nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \\nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \\nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \\nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \\nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\\n\\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \\nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \\nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \\nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \\nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \\nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \\nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \\nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \\nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \\nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \\neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \\nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \\nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \\ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \\naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \\nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\\n\\n\\nReview of COCOM\\n\\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \\nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \\nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \\ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \\nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \\ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\\n\\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\\n\\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \\nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \\nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \\nother states.\\n\\n\\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\\n\\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \\nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \\nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \\ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \\nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \\nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \\nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \\nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \\nthis process.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral Test Ban\\n\\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \\nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \\nand that the two governments would consult with each other \\naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \\nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \\nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \\nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \\nmonths.    \\n\\n\\nDetargeting\\n\\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \\ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \\ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \\nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \\npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \\nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \\nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \\nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \\n\\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\\n\\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \\nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \\ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \\nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \\nlate May.\\n\\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \\nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \\nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \\nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \\nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \\nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \\ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \\nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \\nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \\nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \\nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \\nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \\nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \\nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \\nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \\nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \\nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\\n\\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \\ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \\npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \\nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \\nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \\nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.

       "  '\\nThe \"so sacred it\\'s secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu',\n",

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#>#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n#>\\n#>That\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\n#>as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\n#>belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\n#>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n#>\\n# \\n#Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.\\n\\nI have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.\\n\\n# \\n#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes\\n#something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>Gullibility,\\n#>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\n#>#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.\\n#>#\\n#>#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\\n#>#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\\n#>\\n#>If you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive.\\n#>\\n# \\n#You, Frank O\\'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any\\n#base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think\\n#you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does\\n#not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.\\n# \\n#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.\\n\\nThe onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that\\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there\\nfor anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.\\n\\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye\\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why\\nare there churches to the square inch in my country?\\n# \\n#>#>Now, *some*\\n#>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n#>\\n#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\n#>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\n#>what you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\n#>of [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\\n#challenged.\\n\\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\\nof which you speak?  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n#>\\n#>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\\'s because it\\'s an irrational\\n#>and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us\\n#>split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\\n#>side of church walls.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights\\n#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.\\n\\nOf course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your\\nwish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.\\n# \\n#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between\\n#that argument and the rise of fanatism. So far, it is just another of your\\n#assertions.\\n\\nSo?  You can do it.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|>(2)  Define \"irrational belief\".  e.g., is it rational to believe that\\n#>#>|>     reason is always useful?\\n#>#>|>\\n#>#>|\\n#>#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason.

No proof, no evidence, just claims.\\n\\nHey - I learned it from you. Did I do good?\\n# \\n# \\n#>At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing \"we had that before\" [we\\n#>didn\\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\\'re back.

Wow, that\\'s an incredible insight.\\n#I don\\'t have to prove them wrong in their opinion. It is possible to\\n#show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims\\n#unreliable or even absurd statements to be information.\\n\\nTotally circular, and totally useless.\\n# \\n#Their wish to believe makes them believe. Things are judges by their appeal,\\n#and not by their information. It makes you feel good when you believe that\\n#may be good for them, but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls. From\\n#belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  I\\'ve seen as many bogus proofs of the \\nnon-existence of gods as I have of their existence.\\n\\n# \\n#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from\\n#logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not\\n#contradict logic. It easily follows that such a system does not allows to\\n#evaluate if its rational in itself. Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency. I use ratiional arguments to show\\n#that my system is consistent or that theirs isn\\'t. The evaluation of the\\n\\nNor this.\\n#predictions does not need rationality.

The\\n#>#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>#>used to obtain it.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#>#of god here.\\n#>#\\n#>#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#>#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#>#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#>#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#>#it that way.\\n#>#\\n#>#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n#>#\\n#>#what is it you are trying to say?\\n#>\\n#>That at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\"\\n#>for no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Nope. There is evidence for it. The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic\\n#basis of a system is difficult, because the possibilities are interwoven.\\n#One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions\\n#that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.\\n\\nI\\'d like to see this alleged evidence.\\n# \\n#One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method\\n#for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that\\'s not\\n#how one feels about it).\\n\\nI see.  You have no irrational beliefs.  But then, fanatics never do, do\\nthey?\\n\\n# \\n#>#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?

       "  \"There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\\n\\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\\n\\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\\nservice center for further information.\\n\\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\\n\\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\\n\\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\\n\\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\\nproblem.\\n\\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\\nlaserjet IV.\\n\\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\\n\\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\\n\\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\\n\\n\",\n",

I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\\nenough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\\n\\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]',\n",

A \"quick\\nlook\" doesn\\'t do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---',\n",

       "  'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPoint 1:\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole\\n\"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings\\nof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.

       "  \"\\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \",\n",

       "  \"Was going over some videos last night.....\\n\\nStudying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very\\ninteresting.  And enlightening.\\n\\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.',\n",

Noring has pointed out\\nthe catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn\\'t\\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn\\'t observe those yeastie\\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\\nmany of them appear to get better.  \\n\\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don\\'t do any\\nbetter than sugar water --- then let\\'s hear it.  If you don\\'t, then what we\\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \\n\\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it\\'s\\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn\\'t change the genuine\\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\\noxidative damage.

If there\\'s some\\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\\nhave been talking about.\\n\\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\\n\\nKen',\n",

Boghosian, \"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity\\nMeeting,\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.\\n\\nATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,\\nincluding the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both\\nArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the \\nArmenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new\\nArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during\\nthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And\\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\\n\\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\\nof ASALA...\\n\\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal...\\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \\nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \\nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued \\nsupport of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \\npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \\nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \\nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \\nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \\nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\\n\\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\\n\\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \\norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\\nPalestinian conflict.\\n\\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\\n\\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\\n\\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\\n\\nNow any comment?\\n\\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\\n\\n \\n \\nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\\n \\n o boy!   \\n \\n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \\n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\\n \\n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \\n given by Serdar Argic .. \\n  \\n You couldn\\'t reject it...\\n \\n \\n Here we go again..\\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author\\'s preface give \\n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\\n pages, please ask by sct) \\n \\n \\nI really don\\'t care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\\ngroundless accussations, etc. \\n \\n[...]\\n \\n \\n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\\n in 1934(Serdar Argic\\'s Reference) has..You couldn\\'t reject it..but, now you\\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\\n \\n Let\\'s see how you lie!..(from \\'non-existing\\' quotes to re-publication)\\n \\n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could\\'t reject it.)\\n \\n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some \\'pretty \\n  well suited theories\\', as usual)\\n \\n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian\\'s lies...I also give the call number\\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \\n                 949.6 R 198\\n   \\n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\\n              \\n     \\n \\n \\n Now, are you claiming that there can\\'t be such a reference by saying \"it is\\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\\n \\n Differences in the number of pages?\\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic\\'s was in 1934..\\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \\n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\\n \\n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\\n first published.. \\n And you tried to hide the whole point..\\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \\n by Serdar Argic exist!! \\n It was the issue, wasn\\'t-it?  \\n \\n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \\n \\n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \\n \\n Any question?\\n \\nSerdar Argic',\n",

Note\\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\\nquestion at hand.\\n\\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.',\n",
       "  '\\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex',\n",

       "  'Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n...\\n\\nSchism and Disobedience\\n\\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\\n\\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection\\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and\\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he\\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\\nheresy.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\\n\\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\\nresponse.\\n\\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics\\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\\nagainst the unity of the Church.\\n\\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\\n\\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\\n\\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\\nparallel Church.\\n\\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\\n\\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\\n\\n....\\n\\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\\n\\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a\\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:',\n",

Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\",\n",

This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.

(This time meeting all the\\nrequirements of myth.)\\n\\n\\nAh, but not everyone \"knows\" that god exists.  So you have\\na fallacy.\\n\\n\\nAnd that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy?\\nRead the FAQ.  If you\\'ve read it, you missed something, so re-read.\\n(Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)\\n\\n\\n...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting\\nit across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn\\'t\\nmake it any more credible to me.\\n\\nIf the Bible says that everyone knows, that\\'s clearly reason\\nto doubt the Bible, because not everyone \"knows\" your alleged\\ngod\\'s alleged existance.\\n\\n\\n1) No, they don\\'t have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far\\nfrom universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\\nit is only a proof that some people have thought that there\\nwas a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\\nwriting it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\\ncase of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the\\nonly thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.\\nAnd that\\'s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the\\ninterpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.\\n\\n2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.\\n\\n3) Again, read the FAQ.\\n\\n\\nBzzt...wrong answer!\\nGravity is directly THERE.  It doesn\\'t stop exerting a direct and\\nrationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the\\nother hand, doesn\\'t generally show up in the supermarket, except\\non the tabloids.  God doesn\\'t exert a rationally undeniable influence.\\nGravity is obvious; gods aren\\'t.\\n\\n\\nNo, human reason hasn\\'t always come back to the existance of\\n\"God\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \"god\".\\nIn other words, it doesn\\'t generally come back to the xtian\\ngod, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much\\nof oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn\\'t pop up as\\nthe idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\\nare and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\\nhuman nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\\nbe and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\\ntendancy to believe in \"God\" only exists in religious wishful\\nthinking.\\n\\n\\nXtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and\\nit\\'s reasonableness certainly doesn\\'t merit eminence.\\nDivine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already\\nbelieve in the divinity.\\nFirst, not all atheists believe the same things about human\\nnature.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object\\nis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\\neven though it is not detectable.\\n\\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\\'t attempted to\\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\\nmisunderstood?\\n\\n\\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the\\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\\n\\nI\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:\\n\\nI\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\\nfrequencies and the chosen \\'amplitudes\\', and the Moral Character being the\\nspectrum over time.\\n\\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can\\'t define it as the\\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\\ntime which compromises one\\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\\nFreud\\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\\nurges or Freud\\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\\'s Ego,\\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

I bought it because\\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:\\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\\n    panning for each voice\\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\\n    access to all eight voices\\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\\n\\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\\nto use so I have avoided it.\\n\\nREASON FOR SALE:\\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.

Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.',\n",

The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\\n\\n-------\\nClients\\n-------\\n\\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large\\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\\n\\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\\n\\n  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.

Examining the what was\\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.

Some that stick out:\\n\\n    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual\\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\\n\\n    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.\\n\\n    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\\n\\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\\n      difference.\\n\\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\\n      one.\\n\\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet.

This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\\n    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.\\n\\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\\n\\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters.

There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.

       "  \"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some\\nhelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\\n\\nThanks.\",\n",

       "  'April 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\nDaniel J.

       "  '\\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call.

       "  '-*----\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.

My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\n",

       "  '\\n       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are\\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\\nabusing gun-control restrictions.

After so many times of getting burned any sane person\\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\\n\\n\\n       I\\'d love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\\npork back to their constituents, there\\'s not a lot I can do.  \\n\\n       It\\'s silly to suggest that if there\\'s anything we can\\'t trust\\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\\ntotal government power.   I\\'ve never been a fan of totalitarianism.\\n\\n\\n       This is very likely.\\n\\n\\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don\\'t have suicide\\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n\\n      The problem\\'s been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\\nyou can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\\n\\n\\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\\n\\n\\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn\\'t.\\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\\nwon\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\\n\\n       You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If\\nyou\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\\nsimply letting them know you\\'re prepared to shoot them would be enough,\\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\\n\\n\\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\\n\\n       You may take that for what it\\'s worth.\\n',\n",

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n\\nReally?  I didn\\'t know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.',\n",

Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

The 51 day\\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\\nassigning blame.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\\n{\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\\n[Reno's] decision.''\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\\nto show their might and just purpose.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\\nwere lost on both sides.

       "  \"\\n\\n\\n  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since\\nrespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This\\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn't.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\n",

Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\\n\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.

Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving.

When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.',\n",
       "  ' (excerpts from posting on this topic) \\n\\n\\n(I\\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\\'re not only in twilight.) :o) \\n\\n\\nNow my comments: \\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. ',\n",

       "  'Folks,\\n\\nIt\\'s time to start building some precise questions to send to our\\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\\nasked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation\\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \\nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \\n\\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\\n     the BATF obtained?\\n\\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \\n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \\n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \\n     on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant \\n     in a manner prescribed by law?\\n\\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\\n     Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an\\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \\n\\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\\n     dispossessed weapons.\\n\\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s\\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \\n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\\n\\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\\n     situation? \\n\\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \\n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \\n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\\n\\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\\n\\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \\n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \\n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \\n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \\n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \\n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \\n     penetrated?\\n\\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\\n\\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition\\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \\n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \\n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \\n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\\n\\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\\n     crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is \\n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \\n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\\n\\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \\n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \\n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \\n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \\n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \\n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \\n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \\n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \\n     shots from high-power rifles?\\n\\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\\n\\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?',\n",

Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",

Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\\n\\tdevices.\\n\\n74F\\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\\n\\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\\n\\n74AS\\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\\n\\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\\n\\n74ALS\\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\\n\\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\\n\\n74C\\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\\n\\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\\n\\tCMOS 74 families.\\n\\n4000\\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\\n\\tclear choice when speed is not important.\\n\\n74HC\\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\\n\\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\\n\\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\\n\\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\\n\\n10K\\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.

You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?

       "  '\\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Data Considerations\\n\\n  The Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\n  Ohio, USA.

This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\",\n",

[Would I kid you?]\\n\\n\\nDoes one man\\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\\ntheir original expression.\\n\\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \\nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\\nof the position.\\n\\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold\\ndifferent moral values (feelings).',\n",

This might be\\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\\nchannel's synth.

       " \"SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL\\n \\n    By Laura Pitter\\n    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist\\nwhen he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim\\ntown of Srebrenica last August.\\n    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody\\nwar, he considers himself a surgeon.\\n    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no\\nlicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives\\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\\nsections.\\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\\npatients.\\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\\nthe dead were women and children.\\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\\nheads.''\\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\\nbecause it increased bleeding.\\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\\n    Then the hunger set in.\\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\\nI left. And I cried too.''\\n\",\n",

If there is any Scripture from\\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\\n\\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \\nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\\nin his writings.\\n\\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position\\nsomewhat disheartening.\\n\\nI understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I\\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\\nturn into no position at all?\\n\\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\\n\\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \\nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\\nLenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!\\n\\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\\narena acknowledges it as valid.\\n\\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\\nschools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a\\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\\nmoral and ethical decisions.\\n\\nWhat do you think? \\n\\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\\nname.)\\n\\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don\\'t have the kinds\\nof morals I want taught.

Literally\\nTzeghagron means \\'to make a religion of one\\'s race.\\' The architect\\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \\nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\\n\\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\\n  Race above everything and before everything.

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help.

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities.

To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \\n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\\n    The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets\\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\\n  of the American Revolution.\\n    Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually\\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary\\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\\n  civil liberties.\\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\\n  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,\\n  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from\\n  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,\\n  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue\\n  Code.',\n",

Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.

Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".

I\\'m not\\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\\nit\\'s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\\'s possible\\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.

I thought the whole idea of God coming\\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\\'s version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can\\'t harm anything, let \\'em go.\").  \\n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\\n\\n\\n\\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.

       " 'Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.\\n\\n[I\\'m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most\\nof our readers probably haven\\'t seen it.  --clh]\\n\\nChrist warns that anyone who \"breaks one of the least of these\\ncommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in\\nthe kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I\\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\\npartisan theology.\\n\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.',\n",

When I got\\nout of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several\\nstudies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing\\ninflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are\\ndiscussed in \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]\\n\\nBut if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be\\npicked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In\\nthe studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the\\nstudies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the\\n_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed\\nlayperson\\'s perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are\\nconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid\\nproducts to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\"\\nIsn\\'t this ratio the issue?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA\\nsupplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs\\nappear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the\\nlow absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).',\n",
       " '\\nSuperficially a good answer, but it isn\\'t that simple.  An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case.\\n',\n",

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

The Administration is \\nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \\ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \\non its government's commitment to reform.\\n\\n\\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\\n\\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \\ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \\nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \\nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \\nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \\nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \\nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \\nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \\nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\\n\\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \\nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \\nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \\nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \\nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \\nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \\nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \\nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \\nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \\nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \\neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \\nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \\nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \\ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \\naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \\nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\\n\\n\\nReview of COCOM\\n\\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \\nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \\nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \\ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \\nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \\ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\\n\\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\\n\\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \\nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \\nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \\nother states.\\n\\n\\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\\n\\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \\nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \\nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \\ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \\nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \\nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \\nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \\nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \\nthis process.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral Test Ban\\n\\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \\nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \\nand that the two governments would consult with each other \\naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \\nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \\nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \\nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \\nmonths.    \\n\\n\\nDetargeting\\n\\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \\ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \\ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \\nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \\npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \\nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \\nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \\nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \\n\\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\\n\\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \\nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \\ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \\nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \\nlate May.\\n\\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \\nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \\nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \\nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \\nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \\nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \\ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \\nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \\nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \\nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \\nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \\nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \\nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \\nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \\nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \\nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \\nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\\n\\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \\ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \\npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \\nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \\nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \\nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \\nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \\nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \\nreform in Russia and the other states.\\n\\n                           *    *    *\\n\\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \\nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \\nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \\nstates.\",\n",

       " '\\nThe \"so sacred it\\'s secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu',\n",

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#>#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n#>\\n#>That\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\n#>as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\n#>belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\n#>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n#>\\n# \\n#Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.\\n\\nI have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.\\n\\n# \\n#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes\\n#something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>Gullibility,\\n#>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\n#>#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.\\n#>#\\n#>#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\\n#>#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\\n#>\\n#>If you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive.\\n#>\\n# \\n#You, Frank O\\'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any\\n#base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think\\n#you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does\\n#not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.\\n# \\n#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.\\n\\nThe onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that\\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there\\nfor anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.\\n\\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye\\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why\\nare there churches to the square inch in my country?\\n# \\n#>#>Now, *some*\\n#>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n#>\\n#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\n#>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\n#>what you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\n#>of [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\\n#challenged.\\n\\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\\nof which you speak?  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n#>\\n#>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\\'s because it\\'s an irrational\\n#>and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us\\n#>split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\\n#>side of church walls.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights\\n#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.\\n\\nOf course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your\\nwish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.\\n# \\n#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between\\n#that argument and the rise of fanatism. So far, it is just another of your\\n#assertions.\\n\\nSo?

I\\'ve seen as many bogus proofs of the \\nnon-existence of gods as I have of their existence.\\n\\n# \\n#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from\\n#logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not\\n#contradict logic. It easily follows that such a system does not allows to\\n#evaluate if its rational in itself. Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency. I use ratiional arguments to show\\n#that my system is consistent or that theirs isn\\'t. The evaluation of the\\n\\nNor this.\\n#predictions does not need rationality.

And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#>#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#>#it that way.\\n#>#\\n#>#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n#>#\\n#>#what is it you are trying to say?\\n#>\\n#>That at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\"\\n#>for no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Nope. There is evidence for it. The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic\\n#basis of a system is difficult, because the possibilities are interwoven.\\n#One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions\\n#that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.\\n\\nI\\'d like to see this alleged evidence.\\n# \\n#One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method\\n#for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that\\'s not\\n#how one feels about it).\\n\\nI see.

Maybe they\\n#>don\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n#>\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\n#>entirely irrelevant.

       " \"There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\\n\\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\\n\\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\\nservice center for further information.\\n\\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\\n\\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\\n\\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\\n\\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\\nproblem.\\n\\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\\nlaserjet IV.\\n\\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\\n\\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\\n\\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\\n\\n\",\n",

This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]',\n",

The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets.

About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize.

       " '\\n\\nPoint 1:\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole\\n\"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings\\nof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\\nJust my \\'NF\\' leanings, I guess.  :^)\\n\\nComments?\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.',\n",

       " \"\\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \",\n",

The general setup is designed so that when users \\n\\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\\n\\tkey and the user\\'s public-private keypair is used to wrap the\\n\\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\\n\\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\\n\\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\\n\\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\\n\\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\\n\\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n\\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\\n\\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\\n\\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)\\n\\n\\tIt seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am\\n\\tassisting in \"entrapment\" (the users would send thier key anyway\\n\\tand are not being enticed into doing something they would not\\n\\totherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?\\n\\n\\tWould the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?\\n\\nAny answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...\\n\\njim',\n",

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.

Our original implementation of the toolkit\\nuses Xsi.\\n\\nOur toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system.\\nIn order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed\\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \\nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\\nand application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\',\\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\\n\\nWe need a function to do this.

Boghosian, \"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity\\nMeeting,\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.\\n\\nATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,\\nincluding the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both\\nArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the \\nArmenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new\\nArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during\\nthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And\\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\\n\\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\\nof ASALA...\\n\\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal...\\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \\nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \\nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued \\nsupport of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \\npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \\nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \\nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \\nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \\nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\\n\\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\\n\\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \\norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\\nPalestinian conflict.\\n\\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\\n\\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\\n\\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\\n\\nNow any comment?\\n\\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\\n\\n \\n \\nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\\n \\n o boy!   \\n \\n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \\n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\\n \\n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \\n given by Serdar Argic .. \\n  \\n You couldn\\'t reject it...\\n \\n \\n Here we go again..\\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author\\'s preface give \\n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\\n pages, please ask by sct) \\n \\n \\nI really don\\'t care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\\ngroundless accussations, etc. \\n \\n[...]\\n \\n \\n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\\n in 1934(Serdar Argic\\'s Reference) has..You couldn\\'t reject it..but, now you\\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\\n \\n Let\\'s see how you lie!..(from \\'non-existing\\' quotes to re-publication)\\n \\n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could\\'t reject it.)\\n \\n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some \\'pretty \\n  well suited theories\\', as usual)\\n \\n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian\\'s lies...I also give the call number\\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \\n                 949.6 R 198\\n   \\n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\\n              \\n     \\n \\n \\n Now, are you claiming that there can\\'t be such a reference by saying \"it is\\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\\n \\n Differences in the number of pages?\\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic\\'s was in 1934..\\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \\n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\\n \\n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\\n first published.. \\n And you tried to hide the whole point..\\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \\n by Serdar Argic exist!! \\n It was the issue, wasn\\'t-it?  \\n \\n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \\n \\n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \\n \\n Any question?\\n \\nSerdar Argic',\n",

Note\\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\\nquestion at hand.\\n\\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.',\n",
       " '\\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.

       " \"Hi Stephen\\nEar wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing\\na barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the\\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \\nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \\nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \\nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\\nit out.\\nGood Luck\\n-heather\\n\",\n",

And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n...\\n\\nSchism and Disobedience\\n\\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\\n\\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection\\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and\\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he\\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\\nheresy.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\\n\\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\\nresponse.\\n\\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics\\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\\nagainst the unity of the Church.\\n\\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\\n\\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\\n\\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\\nparallel Church.\\n\\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\\n\\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\\n\\n....\\n\\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\\n\\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a\\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:',\n",

       " \"I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\",\n",

In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:\\nMontenegrins, and Makedonijans. \\n\\nNations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, \"Muslim\"\\nis much more a political term than a religious term (for those who \\ndifferentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not \\na \"Christo-Slavic\" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it\\nwas the \"Atheist Communist\" ideology of Tito.

This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.

I haven\\'t attempted to\\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals.

My opinion (for what it is worth)\\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the\\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\\n\\nI\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:\\n\\nI\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities).

Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.

The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).

They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \\n\\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\\n\\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\\nperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\\nSome people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their\\nchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\\n\\nGod be with you,\",\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there\\'s a growing feeling that the \\nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \\nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.',\n",

The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.

       " '\\nThere are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very\\nwide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.\\nNo private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...\\nand as our private sector has discovered, they\\'re better off not\\noffering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.\\n(-;\\n\\n\\nThe alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,\\ndoctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you\\ncan\\'t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\\nwill not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered\\nby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.\\nAgain, they can\\'t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.\\n\\nPlus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I\\'m basically\\nanti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can\\'t\\nbring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I\\nunderstand where you\\'re coming from.  Up north, you\\'re so much more\\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\\n\\n\\nYes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in\\nthat verbose blurb ...\\n\\n\\nIn Canada and Germany, it\\'s not mandatory.  However, it is negative\\noption in that you must request the exemption.  That the private\\nsector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option\\n(as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...\\n\\n\\nYes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are\\ntoo small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so\\nyou pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get\\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors\\nmonopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby\\nNEVER tells you down here ...\\n\\n\\nNo, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends\\nare (-;) but there\\'s the question of our small market dynamics up\\nnorth ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell\\ntheir services to Americans to generate more business will inflate\\ntheir effective population served, and thus make some specialties\\nfinally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do\\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\\n\\n\\nUh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness\\nfunds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re\\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra\\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\\n\\nRemember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos\\nRochester does and they\\'re also a company town.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but\\nI\\'ve come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about\\nour \"system\".

The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.

Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.

Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.

Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).

The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.

There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.',\n",

       " 'April 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.

My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card.

       " '-*----\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.  It\\'s easy\\nto read.  Give it a try.',\n",

       " \"\\n  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago\\nabout breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)\\nAs far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult\\nto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:\\n  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out \\n    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own\\n    breathing effort (let alone anything else)\\n\\n  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is\\n    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled\\n    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)\\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\\n\\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\\n    gas per unit volume. \\n\\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \\n\",\n",

In their names we demand justice.\\n\\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \\nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \\ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \\nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \\nTurkey!

The\\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey\\'s Kurdish\\npopulation.\\n\\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\\n\\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\\n\\n',\n",

My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.

       " '\\n       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are\\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\\nabusing gun-control restrictions.  I don\\'t think it is paranoid\\nto worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused\\nin thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person\\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\\n\\n\\n       I\\'d love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\\npork back to their constituents, there\\'s not a lot I can do.  \\n\\n       It\\'s silly to suggest that if there\\'s anything we can\\'t trust\\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\\ntotal government power.   I\\'ve never been a fan of totalitarianism.\\n\\n\\n       This is very likely.\\n\\n\\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don\\'t have suicide\\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n\\n      The problem\\'s been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\\nyou can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\\n\\n\\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\\n\\n\\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn\\'t.\\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\\nwon\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\\n\\n       You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If\\nyou\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\\nsimply letting them know you\\'re prepared to shoot them would be enough,\\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\\n\\n\\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\\n\\n       You may take that for what it\\'s worth.\\n',\n",

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n\\nReally?  I didn\\'t know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.',\n",

Clarke\\n\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\\nOrig. Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

The 51 day\\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\\nassigning blame.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\\n{\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\\n[Reno's] decision.''\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\\nto show their might and just purpose.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\\nBranch Davidians.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\\nand a city block razed.\\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\\\it This policy of no-knock\\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\\nand seizures''] are not denied.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\noindent Matthew L.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since\\nrespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This\\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn't.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\n",

       " ' (excerpts from posting on this topic) \\n\\n\\n(I\\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\\'re not only in twilight.) :o) \\n\\n\\nNow my comments: \\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. ',\n",

       " 'Folks,\\n\\nIt\\'s time to start building some precise questions to send to our\\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\\nasked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation\\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \\nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \\n\\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\\n     the BATF obtained?\\n\\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \\n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \\n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \\n     on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant \\n     in a manner prescribed by law?\\n\\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\\n     Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an\\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \\n\\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\\n     dispossessed weapons.\\n\\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s\\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \\n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\\n\\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\\n     situation? \\n\\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \\n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \\n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\\n\\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\\n\\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \\n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \\n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \\n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \\n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \\n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \\n     penetrated?\\n\\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\\n\\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition\\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \\n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \\n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \\n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\\n\\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\\n     crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is \\n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \\n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\\n\\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \\n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \\n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \\n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \\n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \\n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \\n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \\n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \\n     shots from high-power rifles?\\n\\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\\n\\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?',\n",

Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

       " '\\nIndeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:\\n\\n  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often\\n  since the foundation of the world; but now once at\\n  the consummation He has been manifested to put away \\n  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.\\n\\n  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die\\n  once, and after this comes judgement;\\n\\n  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear\\n  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to\\n  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.\\n\\n\\nThe first point is that this verse is part of an even larger\\ncontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of the\\nindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ\\'s\\nsacrifice, \"once\", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen \\nmankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \\n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",

Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\\n\\tdevices.\\n\\n74F\\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\\n\\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\\n\\n74AS\\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\\n\\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\\n\\n74ALS\\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\\n\\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\\n\\n74C\\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.

The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.

Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.

Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?

       " '\\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.

Would you rather have someone love\\n: you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to\\n: love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward\\n: Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.\\n\\nIndeed, \"knock and it shall be opened to you\". Dan, why didn\\'t this work?\\nI firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was\\nonly deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason\\nwhat kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I \\nhad sillily attributed to divine forces or devil\\'s attempts to \\ndestroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy\\nto achieve the same mental states at will. \\n\\nMy faith was just learned fear in a disguise.\\n\\n: Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.\\n\\nGod is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years?\\nIf sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief -\\nwhat it was in my case - I\\'d rather quit. If god does not help me to\\nkeep the faith, I can\\'t go on. \\n\\nBesides, I am concerned with god\\'s morality and mental health. Does\\nshe really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,\\nguidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn\\'t\\nshe make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who\\nrefuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture\\nfor those who can\\'t believe?\\n\\nI love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,\\nshe\\'ll know what to do. \\n\\n: Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see\\n: that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with \"logic\".\\n: Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is\\n: the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never\\n: know more than you do now. \\n\\nYour argument is of the type \"you\\'ll know once you try\".\\nYet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed\\nfor many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that \\nthey had lived in a virtual reality.\\n\\nWhat else but reason I can use?
