In the meantime, however, the market remains tight. U.S. stocks of distillate fuels are near 14-year lows, the U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday.\\nTraders also cited comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested an aggressive path for increasing U.S. interest rates in coming months.

       "      <td>By Barani Krishnan\\nInvesting.com -- Oil prices rose almost 2% Thursday as those who sold crude down in the past two sessions covered their shorts amid a return of the supply issues that had fueled much of this year’s energy rally.\\nBrent, the London-traded global benchmark for crude, settled up $1.53, or 1.4%, at $108.33 per barrel. \\nBrent had lost almost 6% over two previous sessions largely due IMF downgrades of 2022/23 global economic growth and the scare over new Covid deaths in China, the world’s second largest consumer of oil.\\nNew York-traded  West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the benchmark for U.S. crude, gained $1.60, or 1.6%, to settle at $103.79 on Thursday. \\nWTI lost a net of more than 5% over the past two days, despite closing up in the previous session. Prior to Wednesday’s rebound, it fell below key $100 support to a session low of $99.89.\\nThursday’s higher close in Brent and WTI came as Germany suggested it will halve its Russian oil imports by the summer and end them by the end of the year. \\nOil traders have disputed for weeks that Berlin and the rest of the EU will be able to disengage with Russia as simply as stated, despite the West’s stand that the action is appropriate and in line with its sanctions against Moscow for the war in Ukraine.\\n“Given how big a market (Germany) is for Russia, accounting for roughly half its exports will come as a real blow” to the supply-demand situation in oil, said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Oil prices are creeping higher again but remain pretty much in the middle of the range they've traded within for the last month.”\\nOil’s narrative was also made more bullish by Libya, which said Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.\\nThe North African country is one of the main contributors to the output of OPEC+, the global oil producing alliance. \\nMade up of 23 countries and officially led by Saudi Arabia, with assistance from Russia, OPEC+ has struggled to meet its output targets for months due to under-investment in global oil fields during the height of the coronavirus outbreak. The situation has worsened since the start of the Feb. 24 Ukraine war and the consequent sanctions on Russia.</td>\n",

It was built at All American Marine shipyard in Bellingham, Washington, and was undergoing tests with the U.S. Coast Guard in nearby Puget Sound.\\n    \"We're here in the water, under hydrogen fuel cell power and it's the first commercial vessel in the world that's got that propulsion system,\" said Pace Ralli, chief executive of  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Maritime, standing on the bow of the ferry in Bellingham Bay.\\nSea Change marks another industry exploring fuel cells as clean-energy cars, trucks, trains and pleasure boats are being developed.\\nAdvocates assert hydrogen fuel cells are cleaner than other carbon-cutting methods as they only emit water and heat, but the high cost and bulky fuel cell systems have limited the use of the technology.\\n    Ralli conceived the idea for the fuel cell-powered ferry while living in New York City, trying to find ways to decarbonize the maritime industry.\\n\"There was a project in California that was being sponsored by the California Air Resources Board, and they were working on hydrogen fuel cell as a method for decarbonizing ships, so we joined up with them and funded their project in 2019,\" Ralli said.\\n    As he spoke, three hydrogen fuel cell stacks whirred in the engine room, helping power two propellers that move the ferry along at a top speed of 20 knots. All American Marine project manager Jeff Sokolik helmed Sea Change, pressing buttons on a touchscreen that engage automated systems communicating with the engine room.\\n\"This is going to be the next standard in fuel-cell driven vessels. They're clean, they're efficient and they make sense economically on scale,\" said Sokolik, who believes this eco-friendly maritime innovation could be widely adopted as soon as 10 years from now.\\nAs companies move toward a zero-emission world, the desire to hit their sustainability targets has risen.\\n    The International Maritime Organization's Greenhouse Gas Study conducted in 2020 states that greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased from 977 million tonnes in 2012 to 1,076 million tonnes in 2018, a 9.6% increase in six years. \\n\"We're focused on the shipping industry because that's where we have expertise, but I don't think any industry can really wait at this point,\" Ralli said.\\n\\n    \"We're really paving the regulatory framework that's needed to take this to a larger harbor craft, whether it's tugs and other larger ferries or even ocean-going vessels like container ships and cruise ships and tankers,\" he adds.\\n    If all goes to plan, Ralli said the boat will be delivered to the Bay Area in late May and serve passengers in June, just in time for San Francisco's summer season. \\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Bloomberg) -- The world’s premier economic and financial club may be irrevocably broken.\\nThe Group of 20, conceived in the 1990s to bring the biggest developed and emerging markets into a single forum to address key global challenges, failed this week to issue a joint communique following a meeting of its finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Washington.\\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also led a partial walkout from a session that featured Russian officials, in protest over their inclusion given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe G-20 has weathered tensions in the past, including the Trump administration’s opposition to language over protectionism in previous declarations from the group. But it’s no longer clear that the likes of the U.S., China and Russia share the same fundamental objectives -- raising the risk that it will fail to serve as a coordinating body for tackling problems ranging from looming food and debt crises to climate change.\\n“Our system of global governance and ability to tackle key global challenges is being disrupted,” said Mark Sobel, a former top Treasury Department international-affairs official who’s now U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank.\\nA confrontation had been brewing since last month, when U.S. President Joe Biden called for the Russians, in the wake of their attack, to be excluded from the G-20. But China and Indonesia, which holds the group’s rotating presidency, wouldn’t go along.\\n‘Profound Question’\\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati of Indonesia, in a Wednesday press briefing following the G-20 finance chiefs’ meeting, said the group “continues as a premier forum for all of us to continue to discuss and talk about all of the issues,” despite the tensions.\\nBut former U.S. Treasury Lawrence Summers, who helped set up the G-20, says it’s now a “very profound question” as to whether it retains its original premise of shared interests in mutual economic development and a determination to jointly solve problems to further that endeavor.\\n“Self evidently, it is not the objective of most of the other members of the G-20 to support Russia’s economic flourishing,” Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid Bloomberg TV contributor, said on Bloomberg’s Stephanomics podcast last week. “It is a substantial question whether we are hoping for the success of the Chinese economy, and whether China is hoping for the success of our economy.”\\nA “variable architecture” could emerge, with different forums featuring participants with more in common but having less reach, and bigger ones where there’s less in common but more reach, Summers said.\\nPivotal Forum\\nWhile the G-7 grouping of democratic, advanced-economy nations remains as a long-standing forum for that group, it’s not big and broad enough to address issues like food insecurity and climate change, Sobel said. (The body included Russia as the Group of Eight from 1998 until the country’s invasion of Crimea in 2014.)\\nThe G-20 was pivotal last year in generating a consensus behind the biggest overhaul in global corporate tax rules in decades -- something the G-7 likely wouldn’t have been able to coordinate. Amid the U.S.-China trade war in 2019, it also served as a forum where Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could at least meet, averting a deeper breakdown in ties.\\n“It’s the only body where you would have Russia, China and India meet face-to-face for days at a time.” said Josh Lipsky, director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “It was more than just a group for talk, it was a group of action.”\\nWhile G-20 communiques weren’t binding sets of commitments, they could be used to call governments to account if they later failed to live up to pledges made.\\nWednesday Dust-up\\nFormed first as a gathering of finance officials following the emerging-market crises of the 1990s, the G-20 became the pre-eminent forum for steering the world economy after the turmoil of 2008, when its leaders began convening summits. An April 2009 gathering in London was a high point, when countries coordinated action to support the world economy and limit further financial fallout.\\nThose heights mark a big contrast with Wednesday’s dust-up, when U.S., Canadian, Danish, British and Ukrainian officials walked out of a morning G-20 session in Washington -- conducted in a hybrid in-person and video format -- just as a Russian representative began speaking. Some others participating remotely reportedly turned off their cameras as part of the protest.\\nThe moment didn’t stop the proceedings, and Spanish, French and German officials didn’t leave the room. A person familiar with the situation said Spain felt compelled to stay, given its status as the current head of an important panel at the International Monetary Fund. Some other European officials opted to remain out of solidarity, the person said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\\nThe split over Russia wasn’t the only symptom of a breakdown over global economic coordination. While Yellen insisted during a press conference Thursday that the group was continuing to get important work done, she also said she was “deeply disappointed” with efforts to organize a debt-service suspension initiative for developing nations that are now struggling after their borrowing swelled to address the pandemic.\\nValue Unclear\\nYellen also said she “specifically called out China” for needing to step up its participation in debt relief. \\nJohn Kirton, director for the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the rift over Russia is harmful in the short run, but not debilitating. Below the level of cabinet ministers, important work will continue among deputies and technical experts, he said. Lipsky agreed.\\nFor that reason, and because of Russia’s declining influence, Kirton was even more optimistic. The disruption this week “does have an impact, but not a serious, prolonged or existential one.”\\nAn important gauge of the G-20’s continuing relevance looms later this year, when members’ leaders are scheduled to gather in Bali, Indonesia, for a summit. Indonesia has invited President Vladimir Putin to attend, despite Washington’s call for Russia to be ejected.\\n“The longer-term question of how we have some steering to cope multilaterally with these kinds of global issues is an open question,” said Sobel, the former U.S. Treasury official. \\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\\n</td>\n",

He was first designated under the Obama administration in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea.\\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department charged Malofeyev with violating sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.\\n\"The United States will work to ensure that the sanctions we have imposed, in close coordination with our international partners, degrade the Kremlin’s ability to project power and fund its invasion,\" Nelson said.\\nThe U.S. State Department is also imposing visa restrictions on over 600 people in a bid to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, barring them from traveling to the United States.\\n\\nThree Russian officials were also hit with visa restrictions over \"gross violations of human rights\" alongside 17 others hit with restrictions over accusations of undermining democracy in Belarus.\\n\"We will use every tool to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\\n \\n</td>\n",

While most of these investments will need to come from the private sector, financing them will require a more supportive framework of fiscal rules and potentially new tools at the European level,\" he said.\\n\\nGermany and several other northern European countries are strongly opposed to such new joint borrowing. \\nGentiloni said the cost of the Ukraine war for Europe would depend on how long it lasts, but that economic and material support to Ukraine, assistance to refugees, as well as continued support to the EU economy to deal with high energy prices and disruptions in production will boost the aggregated EU budget deficit by at least 0.6% of GDP this year. \\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>By Steve Holland\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $800 million in more weaponry for Ukraine on Thursday and said he would ask Congress for more money to help bolster support for the Ukrainian military as it faces a fresh onslaught by Russia on its eastern flank. \\nAddressing Americans from the White House's Roosevelt Room, Biden pledged to send heavy artillery, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as tactical drones, as he called on Congress for supplemental funding to provide additional aid for Kyiv.\\nBiden also announced $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government as it battles to save the lives of people under siege by Russian forces.\\n\"We’re in a critical window now of time where they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said, referring to Russia's tactical shift to the east. The United States and allies are “moving as fast as possible” to provide Ukraine with the equipment and weapons it needs.\\nBiden said the new assistance will expend most of the remaining funds available for this purpose and that he will make a supplemental funding request to Congress next week. He said the amount is being discussed.\\n\"That’s being decided now. I’m asking the Defense Department to put together a proposal,\" he said.\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives will consider the additional aid for Ukraine as soon as next week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. There is strong support among Democrats and Republicans for assisting Ukraine. \\nThe Pentagon said that the new package would include 75 155mm long-range howitzers, 72 tactical vehicles to tow them, and more than 100 Phoenix Ghost drones.\\nBiden spoke after face-to-face talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who is in Washington for a variety of meetings.\\nThe president announced plans to ban Russian-affiliated ships from docking at U.S. ports, as previously reported by Reuters, further ratcheting up pressure on Moscow. A senior administration official said the move was aimed at further isolating Russia. \\nBiden also said his administration will allow Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their home country to come to the United States temporarily if they have American sponsors, a move that could affect thousands of refugees.\\nThe new arms package is the same size as an $800 million one announced last week \\nBiden said the new weapons are needed as Ukraine battles a major offensive from Russia in the east, where the flatter terrain requires a different set of weaponry.\\nOn Wednesday, he convened U.S. military leaders in an annual White House gathering that took on special significance as the war enters a risky new phase. \\nRussia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to \"liberate\" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Western allies anticipate Russia's campaign could last many months, grind to a stalemate and test the battlefield capabilities of Ukrainian fighters.\\nBiden disputed Russian claims of control of the embattled city of Mariupol, saying that \"there's no evidence that Mariupol has completely fallen.\" He added that Russia \"should allow humanitarian corridors to let people at that steel mill and other places (that) are buried under rubble to get out.\"\\nRussia says it launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24 to demilitarize and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. \\nU.S. forces are not fighting in Ukraine but are indirectly engaged, arming, training and financing its forces.\\n\\nThe U.S. aid announced last week included artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, broadening the scope of materiel sent to Kyiv to include new types of heavy equipment.\\nAdding this week's package brings total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded to well over $3 billion.\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>As Russia teeters on the brink of a historic default, foreign investors in the country's debt have few palatable options to recover their money: bet on costly legal action, trust bilateral agreements will stand, or sit on their hands. \\nForeign creditors would typically try to band together to negotiate, go to court or in some cases seek arbitration in cases of default, but Western sanctions in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and the peculiarities of Russian sovereign bonds make those options hard at the moment, lawyers said.\\nSome $40 billion of Russian sovereign debt issued in dollars and euros is outstanding, with about half of that held by foreigners. Under terms of most of that debt, Moscow must pay investors in the currency in which the bonds are denominated. \\nWestern sanctions cut off Moscow’s access to some $300 billion in gold and foreign currency reserves it held in banks abroad. That means Moscow must either use whatever hard currency it has at home to pay investors, or default on its obligations.\\nRussia says it has the money and is willing to pay but cannot do so because of the sanctions imposed in response to what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. It said it would use its own currency if it cannot pay in foreign currency until its reserves are unfrozen.\\nIt has made a $649 million payment that was due on April 4 on two of its bonds in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the debt, a move a derivatives watchdog ruled a \"potential failure to pay\". \\nRating agencies have said Russia may be in default because the payment must be made in dollars or due to a perceived lack of willingness to repay, with S&amp;P lowering its foreign currency ratings to \"selective default\".\\nOnce a 30-day grace period to the April 4 bond payments passes in early May, investors would have three options, said Dennis Hranitzky, head of sovereign litigation at law firm Quinn Emanuel. \\nThey could wait and see what happens, take legal action against Russia in court, or seek arbitration under bilateral treaties that Russia has with dozens of countries, he said.\\nWith the situation around sanctions changing as the war rages on, the first option is the most likely one, said Hranitzky and other lawyers who are in touch with bondholders.\\n\"I don't think we know enough about how this is going to unfold, we don't know how long the war is going to last,\" said Hranitzky.\\nLEGAL ACTION\\nThe situation with Russia is unprecedented. \\nOne lawyer said the closest historical parallels, where geopolitics are the main driving force in a potential default scenario, are when U.S. President Jimmy Carter cut off Iran's oil sales and froze its assets abroad in response to the 1979 hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, and when Britain encouraged banks to declare Argentina in default in the wake of the 1982 Falklands/Malvinas war.\\nIn both cases, the crisis eventually abated as did the political pressure, said veteran debt lawyer Lee Buchheit.\\n\"It's been 40 years since we have seen anything quite like this,\" said Buchheit, who has worked on such sovereign debt restructurings as Greece and Argentina. \"This is not a financial problem; it is a pure political one.\" \\nBondholders can try to take matters to court but this is often a costly and lengthy process aimed at either getting compensation or seizing assets. In the case of Russia, legal action will be even more fraught, the lawyers said.\\nFor one, the contracts of the bonds in question do not define a jurisdiction in case of a dispute, which will make it more challenging for bondholders to decide on the venue they use to sue.\\nLawyers also expect Moscow to mount a defense blaming sanctions for its inability to pay after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia would take legal action if the West forces it to default. \\nThe bond contract is bound by English law, under which the argument of frustration of purpose could be made, meaning that Moscow could argue that it tried to pay but the West wouldn’t let it because of the sanctions.\\n\"Russia is going to argue this,\" said Mitu Gulati, a law professor at the University of Virginia and expert on debt restructurings. However, he expected Moscow would have limited success. \"Yes, this is a war, but it is a war caused by Russia.\"\\nAnother option for investors would be to seek arbitration directly against Russia. An investor-state arbitration allows creditors from jurisdictions with bilateral investment treaties to bring claims and seek monetary damages and other relief directly against the state.\\nRussia has dozens of such treaties, including with most of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\\n\\nAn arbitration award like that could be enforced in U.S. courts, said Hranitzky, whose firm also represents Ukraine's government in financial disputes with Russia.\\n\"The nightmare scenario is that the situation in Ukraine is not resolved and sanctions remain in place for months, maybe longer,\" Buchheit said. \\n \\n</td>\n",

The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling if the CDC determined the 14-month-old mandate was still needed.\\nThe Justice Department filed notice appealing the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court, but did not detail if it intended to seek an emergency order to reinstate the requirement or detail the grounds for the appeal.\\nThe CDC said on Wednesday it had asked the Justice Department to proceed with the appeal and that \"an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health.\"\\nAirlines quickly dropped the mandate Monday evening soon after the White House informed reporters and industry officials that the government would no longer enforce the mandate. Social media users posted videos of airline employees on some trips announcing the mandate had ended mid-flight with many cheering the news, while some expressed anger that the mask rules were abruptly dropped.\\nThe mandate applied to planes, trains, ride-share vehicles and other public transportation and, prior to Monday's ruling, had been due to expire on May 3 unless the CDC sought a new extension.\\nThe U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that \"masks were critically important during the height of the pandemic\" but in the current environment \"required masking on public transportation is simply out of step with the current public health landscape.\"\\n\\nThe ruling followed other court judgments against Biden administration directives to fight the infectious disease that has killed nearly 1 million Americans, including vaccination or COVID testing mandates for employers.\\nThe CDC also lost court battles on COVID-19 mandates, notably when the Supreme Court in August ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions.\\n \\n</td>\n",

While most Ukrainians will want to remain in Europe, the Biden administration says, the new initiative will make it easier for those with family or other sponsors in the United States to travel there.\\n\"This program will be fast, it will be streamlined, and will ensure the United States honors its commitment (to) the people of Ukraine,\" Biden said during remarks at the White House.\\nAny person outside the United States can already apply for humanitarian parole but must demonstrate an urgent reason to be allowed to enter the country or that their entry will significantly benefit the United States. \\nMore than 350 Ukrainians have already sought humanitarian parole to enter the United States since the start of the conflict through early April, Reuters reported this month.\\nThe new program set to begin on Monday will require U.S. sponsors to apply on behalf of Ukrainians and will offer an accelerated process, one of the officials said on Thursday. Approved Ukrainians will be eligible for work permits, DHS said.\\nIn addition to humanitarian parole, Biden aims to improve access to other pathways for Ukrainians to enter the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program and existing visa avenues.\\nThe effort to bring up to 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States could stretch beyond the current fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the administration has said.\\nWhile thousands of Ukrainians have entered the United States via the border with Mexico and some on legal visas, only 12 Ukrainians came through the U.S. refugee program in March.\\nUkrainians in Europe should apply to the new parole program from there and not travel to Mexico to enter the United States, DHS said.\\n\\nAbout 3,300 Ukrainians were encountered by U.S. southern border authorities in March, according to U.S. government data.\\nThe number of Ukrainians attempting to enter at the border rose sharply in April, according to internal U.S. government figures reviewed by Reuters, with an average of about 1,000 per day arriving from April 10-16.\\n \\n</td>\n",

The event includes a formal West Wing meeting as well as a dinner in the president's residence with leaders' spouses afterward. \\nWhile the annual military policy meeting rarely makes news, weighty issues are on the agenda this year, topped by a conflict in Ukraine that officials fear could imperil European security for years to come. \\nRussia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to \"liberate\" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

       "      <td>Ukraine proposed talks with Moscow over evacuating troops and civilians from Mariupol after a Russian surrender-or-die ultimatum expired on Wednesday, leaving many trapped at a steel plant, the last main stronghold of resistance. \\nA few dozen civilians managed to leave the strategically important southeastern port in a small bus convoy, according to Reuters witnesses, escaping the fiercest battle of the nearly eight-week-long war.\\nA Ukrainian marine commander, Serhiy Volny, said fighters there may not be able to hold out for much longer. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering at the steel works. \\nUkraine is ready for a \"special round of negotiations\" with no conditions \"to save our guys, (the far right) Azov (battalion), military, civilians, children, the living and the wounded,\" negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.\\nFighters remain holed up in the plant and have ignored an ultimatum by Russia to surrender. David Arakhamia, a second negotiator, said in an online post that he and Podolyak were in constant contact with Ukrainian forces in the city.\\n\"Today, in a conversation with the city defenders, a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison,\" he said. \"For our part, we are ready to arrive for such negotiations at any time as soon as we receive confirmation from the Russian side.\"\\nFewer civilians than hoped left on Wednesday, according to the authorities. \\nOver five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. Russia has yet to capture any major cities.\\nUkraine said it had so far held off an assault by thousands of Russian troops attempting to advance in what Kyiv calls the Battle of the Donbas, a new campaign to seize two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\\nRussia's forces had carried out strikes on dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine and had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near the village of Koroviy Yar, its defence ministry said. \\nOn Wednesday, Russia conducted a first test launch of its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new and long-awaited addition to its nuclear arsenal.\\n\"This truly unique weapon will ... provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country,\" President Vladimir Putin said. \\nRussia calls its incursion a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise and \"denazify\" Ukraine.

She was leaving the city with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson.\\n\"It is a pleasure ... to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,\" she said tearfully. \\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave.\\nRussia did not immediately respond to the allegation.\\nIt denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the failure of earlier attempts to organise humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol.\\nThe deputy commander of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol, Svyatoslav Kalamar, said several bunkers under the plant still held about 80-100 civilians each.\\nJust five people in Mariupol had surrendered following Moscow's 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) surrender-or-die ultimatum, Russian-backed separatists said. \\nUkraine has proposed swapping Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for trapped civilians and soldiers. \\nIf Russia captured Mariupol it would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.\\nMoscow was forced to retreat from northern Ukraine after an assault on Kyiv was repelled last month, but has poured troops back in for an assault on the east that began this week.\\nPutin says Ukraine mistreated Russian speakers in the Donbas, an accusation Kyiv dismisses as false.\\nRussia was focusing on advancing towards the strategically important Donbas city of Sloviansk, but \"so far they are not succeeding\", Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said. \\nPEACE TALKS ELUSIVE\\nMeanwhile, peace negotiations have stalled. \\nThe Kremlin accused Kyiv on Wednesday of delaying the talks and changing its positions. Kyiv accuses Moscow of blocking talks by refusing humanitarian ceasefires.\\nThe head of Ukraine's Orthodox Church asked clergy and the faithful to forgo services on Easter Saturday night in areas affected by fighting, fearing the Russian bombardments will continue without respite.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden was convening top U.S. military leaders on Wednesday in an annual White House gathering that takes on special significance as the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and Washington plans more military aid.\\nCharles Michel, head of the European Council that groups the 27 EU member states, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv in a show of solidarity. \\n \\n</td>\n",

       "0   As a candidate, Joe Biden made climate change a pillar of his campaign for the White House, promising to decarbonize the U.S. economy, end drilling on public lands, and lead the world in a historic shift away from fossil fuels.\\nBut more than a year into his presidency, Biden has instead been forced by rampant inflation and a war in Europe to prioritize energy security, leading his administration to unleash record amounts of crude oil from strategic reserves and to urge drillers to pump harder to keep up with demand.\\nThe jarring shift in Biden’s energy policy priorities reflects the difficulties any U.S. administration might face in attempting a sweeping, decades-long reform of the country's massive energy economy to curb global warming while simultaneously assisting geopolitical allies and keeping consumer prices in check. \\nFailing to achieve that balance could have big political consequences for Biden’s fellow Democrats in November’s mid-term elections: conservatives will blame the party if pump prices stay high, while progressives will punish it if it backslides on its climate promises. \\n“The reality is there has to be short-term costs for long-term gain and I'm not sure this administration is willing to pay the price,\" said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston, referring to the political and financial costs of fighting climate change.\\nWhite House spokesperson Jen Psaki, asked this week whether the president was still confident the U.S. could hit his climate targets given the headwinds, didn't forecast

       "1   By David Gaffen\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Thursday, buffeted by concerns about tightened supply as the European Union (EU) mulls a potential ban on Russian oil imports that would further restrict worldwide oil trade.\\nBrent crude futures settled up $1.53 to close at $108.33 a barrel, after earlier reaching a high of $109.80. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended up $1.60, or 1.6%, to $103.79, after earlier reaching a high of $105.42.\\nBuyers also reacted to ongoing interruptions in Libya, which is losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.\\nBrent has gained nearly 8% in the last seven trading days, but the rally has come at a slow, grinding pace, unlike the frenzy that accompanied moves in late February when Russia invaded Ukraine and in mid-March as well. \\n\"It's not as easy a trade as it was a couple of weeks ago,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group. \"You have to risk more, and that may be by design with these hedge funds and algo funds trading more.\" \\nThe market sold off somewhat after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that the EU needs to be careful about a complete ban on imports of Russian energy because it would likely cause oil prices to spike. \\nThe EU is still weighing such a ban over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise its neighbour.\\nFlynn said the market is weighing the possibility that, down the road, slowed growth or additional supply could undermine the bullish case for oil. In the meantime, however, the market remains tight. U.S. stocks of distillate fuels are near 14-year lows, the U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday.\\nTraders also cited comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested an aggressive path for increasing U.S. interest rates in coming months. That could drag on growth, reducing demand for energy products.\\nU.S. crude exports rose to more than 4 million barrels a day last week, partially offsetting the losses of Russian crude hit by sanctions from the United States and European nations. [EIA/S]\\nThe oil market remains tight with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, together called OPEC+, struggling to meet their production targets and with U.S. crude stockpiles down sharply in the week ended April 15. [EIA/S]\\n\\n\"With only two countries in the OPEC+ alliance holding significant spare capacity, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the group is sticking to a cautious approach in unwinding pandemic-related production cuts,\" UBS said in a note.\\nThe demand outlook in China continues to weigh on the market, as the world's biggest oil importer slowly eases strict COVID-19 curbs that have hit manufacturing activity and global supply chains.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2   By Barani Krishnan\\nInvesting.com -- Oil prices rose almost 2% Thursday as those who sold crude down in the past two sessions covered their shorts amid a return of the supply issues that had fueled much of this year’s energy rally.\\nBrent, the London-traded global benchmark for crude, settled up $1.53, or 1.4%, at $108.33 per barrel. \\nBrent had lost almost 6% over two previous sessions largely due IMF downgrades of 2022/23 global economic growth and the scare over new Covid deaths in China, the world’s second largest consumer of oil.\\nNew York-traded  West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the benchmark for U.S. crude, gained $1.60, or 1.6%, to settle at $103.79 on Thursday. \\nWTI lost a net of more than 5% over the past two days, despite closing up in the previous session. Prior to Wednesday’s rebound, it fell below key $100 support to a session low of $99.89.\\nThursday’s higher close in Brent and WTI came as Germany suggested it will halve its Russian oil imports by the summer and end them by the end of the year. \\nOil traders have disputed for weeks that Berlin and the rest of the EU will be able to disengage with Russia as simply as stated, despite the West’s stand that the action is appropriate and in line with its sanctions against Moscow for the war in Ukraine.\\n“Given how big a market (Germany) is for Russia, accounting for roughly half its exports will come as a real blow” to the supply-demand situation in oil, said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Oil prices are creeping higher again but remain pretty much in the middle of the range they've traded within for the last month.”\\nOil’s narrative was also made more bullish by Libya, which said Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.\\nThe North African country is one of the main contributors to the output of OPEC+, the global oil producing alliance. \\nMade up of 23 countries and officially led by Saudi Arabia, with assistance from Russia, OPEC+ has struggled to meet its output targets for months due to under-investment in global oil fields during the height of the coronavirus outbreak. The situation has worsened since the start of the Feb. 24 Ukraine war and the consequent sanctions on Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3   U.S. companies can help rebuild Ukraine with digital infrastructure, clean energy and more in the aftermath of Russia's invasion, U.S. Export-Import Bank President Reta Jo Lewis said on Thursday before a meeting with Ukraine finance officials.\\n\"We want Ukraine to win. That's why we're doing everything we can to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,\" Lewis said.\\nUkraine's finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, welcomed the strong U.S. support and said his country is looking for bridge financing to fill gaps in its budget.\\nThe country's central bank governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, said the Ukrainian banking system was in good shape and that payment systems are functioning, nearly two months after Russia launched its Feb. 24 assault on its Eastern European neighbor.\\nUkraine is expected to lose a third of its gross domestic product in 2022 under a moderately optimistic scenario, Shevchenko said.\\nHe said Ukraine had received nearly $4 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Union, among others, but would need continued funding to cover gaps in its budget.\\n\\n\"In order to keep sufficient level of these resources, it will be crucial for us to continue to continue receiving official finances from our international partners,\" Shevchenko said, adding that his government was counting on U.S.

       "4   The San Francisco Bay will soon have a new fossil fuel-free ferry floating in its waters, propelled completely by hydrogen fuel cells, and officials hope it heralds change on the high seas.\\nAptly named Sea Change, the 70-foot (21-meter), 75-passenger ferry will service multiple stops along San Francisco's waterfront. It was built at All American Marine shipyard in Bellingham, Washington, and was undergoing tests with the U.S. Coast Guard in nearby Puget Sound.\\n    \"We're here in the water, under hydrogen fuel cell power and it's the first commercial vessel in the world that's got that propulsion system,\" said Pace Ralli, chief executive of  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Maritime, standing on the bow of the ferry in Bellingham Bay.\\nSea Change marks another industry exploring fuel cells as clean-energy cars, trucks, trains and pleasure boats are being developed.\\nAdvocates assert hydrogen fuel cells are cleaner than other carbon-cutting methods as they only emit water and heat, but the high cost and bulky fuel cell systems have limited the use of the technology.\\n    Ralli conceived the idea for the fuel cell-powered ferry while living in New York City, trying to find ways to decarbonize the maritime industry.\\n\"There was a project in California that was being sponsored by the California Air Resources Board, and they were working on hydrogen fuel cell as a method for decarbonizing ships, so we joined up with them and funded their project in 2019,\" Ralli said.\\n    As he spoke, three hydrogen fuel cell stacks whirred in the engine room, helping power two propellers that move the ferry along at a top speed of 20 knots. All American Marine project manager Jeff Sokolik helmed Sea Change, pressing buttons on a touchscreen that engage automated systems communicating with the engine room.\\n\"This is going to be the next standard in fuel-cell driven vessels. They're clean, they're efficient and they make sense economically on scale,\" said Sokolik, who believes this eco-friendly maritime innovation could be widely adopted as soon as 10 years from now.\\nAs companies move toward a zero-emission world, the desire to hit their sustainability targets has risen.\\n    The International Maritime Organization's Greenhouse Gas Study conducted in 2020 states that greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased from 977 million tonnes in 2012 to 1,076 million tonnes in 2018, a 9.6% increase in six years. \\n\"We're focused on the shipping industry because that's where we have expertise, but I don't think any industry can really wait at this point,\" Ralli said.\\n\\n    \"We're really paving the regulatory framework that's needed to take this to a larger harbor craft, whether it's tugs and other larger ferries or even ocean-going vessels like container ships and cruise ships and tankers,\" he adds.\\n    If all goes to plan, Ralli said the boat will be delivered to the Bay Area in late May and serve passengers in June, just in time for San Francisco's summer season. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "6   German exports to Russia slumped by 57.5% to 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in March because of sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, Germany's Federal Statistical Office said on Thursday.\\nThat decline demoted Russia to Germany's 12th-biggest export market outside the European Union, down from fifth in February.\\nRussian troops invaded Ukraine in what Moscow calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24, prompting the West to impose tough sanctions. These include export restrictions.\\nOverall, German exports to countries outside the European Union fell by 7.2% to 52.8 billion euros in March compared with February. However, they were 3.2% higher than in March 2021.\\nThe United States was still the biggest export market for Germany, with goods worth 13.5 billion euros being shipped there in March, 21% more than a year earlier. Goods worth 10.2 billion euros were exported to China, 1% less than a year earlier, while exports to Britain eased by 0.3% to 6.4 billion euros.\\n\\nGermany's BGA trade association said last month a survey of its members showed most expected an economic slowdown as a result of the Ukraine conflict, but that business nonetheless backed the government's sanctions against Russia.\\n($1 = 0.9214

       "7   By David Milliken\\nLONDON (Reuters) -British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland walked out of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting in Washington to protest the invasion of Ukraine when Russia's delegate spoke on Thursday, a British finance ministry spokesperson said.\\nBefore walking out, Sunak \"described (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's assault on Ukraine as an assault on the rules and norms that are the foundation of our economic way of life,\" the spokesperson said.\\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who walked out of a G20 meeting in Washington on Wednesday for the same reason, said on Thursday there should be \"no appeasement\" of Russia due to the economic problems caused by the invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe G20 includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia and South Africa which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.\\nG20 finance ministers and central bank governors met on the sidelines of a semi-annual conference held by the IMF and World Bank in Washington, with the Ukraine war, food security and ongoing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic the key topics.\\nAfter Canada's Freeland returned to the meeting, she directly addressed Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who was attending virtually, a source familiar with what happened in the meeting room said.\\n\"It is perverse and absurd to hear you speaking today when your war is making us poorer,\" she said, according to the source. \\n\"Your war is causing food prices to rise and will cause people to go hungry. Your war is causing energy prices to rise. Your war is driving inflation, which hurts the most vulnerable.\"\\nCanada's finance ministry declined to comment.\\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory, but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\\nFreeland, who is of Ukrainian descent and has made impassioned pleas on behalf of the country, went on to speak about how women were \"the particular targets of this war.\"\\n\"Rape is being used systematically as a weapon of war by Russia,\" Freeland said, according to the source.\\n\\nAddressing Siluanov by name, she concluded by saying Ukraine would win the war and \"Russia and the Russian leadership will bear full responsibility for the crimes being committed today\". \\nEarlier on Thursday, Britain ramped up trade sanctions on Russia, targeting luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds through import bans and higher tariffs, seeking to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "9   (Bloomberg) -- The world’s premier economic and financial club may be irrevocably broken.\\nThe Group of 20, conceived in the 1990s to bring the biggest developed and emerging markets into a single forum to address key global challenges, failed this week to issue a joint communique following a meeting of its finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Washington.\\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also led a partial walkout from a session that featured Russian officials, in protest over their inclusion given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe G-20 has weathered tensions in the past, including the Trump administration’s opposition to language over protectionism in previous declarations from the group. But it’s no longer clear that the likes of the U.S., China and Russia share the same fundamental objectives -- raising the risk that it will fail to serve as a coordinating body for tackling problems ranging from looming food and debt crises to climate change.\\n“Our system of global governance and ability to tackle key global challenges is being disrupted,” said Mark Sobel, a former top Treasury Department international-affairs official who’s now U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank.\\nA confrontation had been brewing since last month, when U.S. President Joe Biden called for the Russians, in the wake of their attack, to be excluded from the G-20. But China and Indonesia, which holds the group’s rotating presidency, wouldn’t go along.\\n‘Profound Question’\\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati of Indonesia, in a Wednesday press briefing following the G-20 finance chiefs’ meeting, said the group “continues as a premier forum for all of us to continue to discuss and talk about all of the issues,” despite the tensions.\\nBut former U.S. Treasury Lawrence Summers, who helped set up the G-20, says it’s now a “very profound question” as to whether it retains its original premise of shared interests in mutual economic development and a determination to jointly solve problems to further that endeavor.\\n“Self evidently, it is not the objective of most of the other members of the G-20 to support Russia’s economic flourishing,” Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid Bloomberg TV contributor, said on Bloomberg’s Stephanomics podcast last week. “It is a substantial question whether we are hoping for the success of the Chinese economy, and whether China is hoping for the success of our economy.”\\nA “variable architecture” could emerge, with different forums featuring participants with more in common but having less reach, and bigger ones where there’s less in common but more reach, Summers said.\\nPivotal Forum\\nWhile the G-7 grouping of democratic, advanced-economy nations remains as a long-standing forum for that group, it’s not big and broad enough to address issues like food insecurity and climate change, Sobel said. (The body included Russia as the Group of Eight from 1998 until the country’s invasion of Crimea in 2014.)\\nThe G-20 was pivotal last year in generating a consensus behind the biggest overhaul in global corporate tax rules in decades -- something the G-7 likely wouldn’t have been able to coordinate. Amid the U.S.-China trade war in 2019, it also served as a forum where Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could at least meet, averting a deeper breakdown in ties.\\n“It’s the only body where you would have Russia, China and India meet face-to-face for days at a time.” said Josh Lipsky, director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “It was more than just a group for talk, it was a group of action.”\\nWhile G-20 communiques weren’t binding sets of commitments, they could be used to call governments to account if they later failed to live up to pledges made.\\nWednesday Dust-up\\nFormed first as a gathering of finance officials following the emerging-market crises of the 1990s, the G-20 became the pre-eminent forum for steering the world economy after the turmoil of 2008, when its leaders began convening summits. An April 2009 gathering in London was a high point, when countries coordinated action to support the world economy and limit further financial fallout.\\nThose heights mark a big contrast with Wednesday’s dust-up, when U.S., Canadian, Danish, British and Ukrainian officials walked out of a morning G-20 session in Washington -- conducted in a hybrid in-person and video format -- just as a Russian representative began speaking. Some others participating remotely reportedly turned off their cameras as part of the protest.\\nThe moment didn’t stop the proceedings, and Spanish, French and German officials didn’t leave the room. A person familiar with the situation said Spain felt compelled to stay, given its status as the current head of an important panel at the International Monetary Fund. Some other European officials opted to remain out of solidarity, the person said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\\nThe split over Russia wasn’t the only symptom of a breakdown over global economic coordination. While Yellen insisted during a press conference Thursday that the group was continuing to get important work done, she also said she was “deeply disappointed” with efforts to organize a debt-service suspension initiative for developing nations that are now struggling after their borrowing swelled to address the pandemic.\\nValue Unclear\\nYellen also said she “specifically called out China” for needing to step up its participation in debt relief. \\nJohn Kirton, director for the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the rift over Russia is harmful in the short run, but not debilitating. Below the level of cabinet ministers, important work will continue among deputies and technical experts, he said. Lipsky agreed.\\nFor that reason, and because of Russia’s declining influence, Kirton was even more optimistic. The disruption this week “does have an impact, but not a serious, prolonged or existential one.”\\nAn important gauge of the G-20’s continuing relevance looms later this year, when members’ leaders are scheduled to gather in Bali, Indonesia, for a summit. Indonesia has invited President Vladimir Putin to attend, despite Washington’s call for Russia to be ejected.\\n“The longer-term question of how we have some steering to cope multilaterally with these kinds of global issues is an open question,” said Sobel, the former U.S. Treasury official. \\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\\n                                                                                          \n",
       "10  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that she was committed to working through the Group of 20 major economies to address difficulties brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite a walkout by her and several other Western officials from a G20 finance meeting as Russian officials spoke.\\n\"I think we were looking for a way to make our disapproval known while still recognizing we have a lot of work to accomplish,\" Yellen told a news conference.\\nYellen said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"so violates international norms\" that the United States and its allies are not going to allow Russia to participate in international institutions, nor listen to its officials' speeches.\\nAnother walkout occurred on Thursday at the International Monetary Fund's steering committee meeting, by British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, people familiar with the action said.\\n\"It simply cannot be business as usual for Russia in terms of its participation in our global forums, whether it's the G20 or other forums where we need to address common challenges,\" Yellen said.\\n\\nShe said that a key piece of the G20's work is to discuss the impact of Russia's \"horrible war of choice\" in Ukraine, including rising energy prices, food insecurity and other effects.\\n\"We're continuing to get that work done,\" she said. \\n \\n

       "11  By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will give Ukraine another $500 million in to help its government continue critical government operations, doubling the $500 million aid pledge by President Joe Biden in March, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday.\\nYellen told a news conference that she shared the aid plans during a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday.\\n\"The needs of Ukraine are urgent, and we plan to deploy this direct aid to Ukraine as soon as possible,\" Yellen said. \"We know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild, and I'm committed to working with Congress and our international allies and partners to build on this support in the medium and long term.\" \\nThe new aid will help Ukraine pay government salaries, pensions and fund social programs necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of its southwestern neighbor.\\nYellen said the $1 billion in direct aid will require the Biden administration to make a supplemental budget request to Congress and she was committed to asking lawmakers for further help for Ukraine.\\n\"We've got to find ways to meet Ukraine's needs,\" she said.\\nShmyhal, who is in Washington to attend the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, is also due to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\nLater, he is due to address an event hosted by the World Bank about Ukraine's financing needs.\\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday said that Ukrainian government estimates that the country needs $5 billion in aid per month to keep its economy operating seem accurate, and the immediate priority was filling that gap for over the next three months. \\nThe World Bank last week estimated that half of Ukraine's businesses are closed, the rest are operating at well below capacity and its GDP this year will collapse by 45% as Russia's invasion rages. \\n\\nThe Treasury official's statement came after G7 finance ministers on Wednesday announced that they had provided and pledged additional support to Ukraine exceeding $24 billion for 2022 and beyond, and vowed to do more as needed.\\nInternational aid for Ukraine between 2014, when Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and 2021 exceeded $60 billion, the Treasury official said.\\n \\n

       "12  By Andrea Shalal\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's refusal to agree to strong language condemning its war in Ukraine prevented the steering committee of the International Monetary Fund from issuing a formal communique on Thursday, the panel's chair said.\\n\"Unfortunately due to one member country breaking away we didn't have the unanimity so as to have the communique,\" Spanish Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, who heads the committee this year, said at a press conference. \\nAhead of Calvino's remarks, two sources had told Reuters that Russia's objections were preventing a full consensus being reached on a formal communique that would have included a strong condemnation of the war that began with its invasion of Ukraine in February. The IMFC issued a \"Chair's Statement\" in its place.\\n\"The chair statement reflects an overwhelming majority view on all the elements...in these dark times, where multilateralism...is more important than ever,\" Calvino said.\\nThe 24-member International Monetary and Financial Committee meets twice a year at the spring and fall meetings of the IMF and World Bank, and advises the IMF Board of Governors. While it has no formal decision-making powers, the IMFC's regular communiques provide strategic direction for the fund's work.\\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine and its massive impact on the global economy have dominated this year's spring meetings of the bank and fund, and high-level meetings held on the sidelines.\\nThe meetings have \"not been business as usual,\" Calvino said, repeating what has become a stock turn of phrase to describe the semi-annual gathering of global finance leaders that has featured walkouts by major western economy officials from sessions attended by Russian officials. U.S., British and Canadian officials again left Thursday's meeting as the Russian delegate spoke.\\nThe IMF on Tuesday slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, noting that Russia's war in Ukraine had fueled inflation, making it a \"clear and present danger\" for many countries.\\nOver five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. \\nThe United States accuses Russia of committing war crimes in what Moscow calls a \"special military operation.\" Russia denies the allegations.\\nThe G20 also failed to issue a communique, although Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who chaired the meeting of G20 finance officials, said many members spoke to condemn Moscow's war in Ukraine.\\nThe G20 and the IMFC include Russia, Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, and China, India, and other countries that have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict. \\n\\nAdding to the drama unfolding in Washington, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner tested positive for COVID-19 late on Wednesday after participating in a series of bilateral meetings and the G20 and G7 finance gatherings earlier in the day.\\nLindner announced the news on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and said he had only mild symptoms thanks to having received three vaccinations. He will isolate in the United States instead of returning to Berlin as planned on Thursday, sources said. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "13  Russia said on Thursday it plans to have a \"digital\" rouble capable of making international payments ready by next year and also wants to expand the number of countries that accept its Visa- and Mastercard-style banking cards that are administrated by the central bank.\\nWith Western sanctions cutting off Russia from large parts of the global financial system, Moscow is looking for alternative ways to make key payments both at home and abroad.\\nThe country's central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said the bank plans for real-world \"digital\" rouble transactions to be possible next year, and that the digital currency could be used in some international settlements.\\n\"The digital rouble is among the priority projects,\" Nabiullina told Russia's lower House of Parliament. \"We have fairly quickly created a prototype ... now we are holding tests with banks and next year we will gradually have pilot transactions.\"\\nRussia, like many other countries around the world, has been developing digital money over the last couple of years to modernise its financial system, speed up payments and head off the threat of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin gaining influence.\\nSome central bank experts have also suggested the new technologies mean countries would be able to deal more directly with each other, making them less dependent on Western-dominated payment channels such as the SWIFT system.\\nThe Bahamas was the first to launch a national digital currency back in 2020, while China is the most advanced among major economies having carried out a mass trial of a digital yuan at the Beijing Winter Olympics this year.\\nNabiullina also said Russia aims to extend the number of countries that accept the central bank's MIR banking cards, an alternative to  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and MasterCard Inc which have joined other Western firms and suspended operations in Russia.\\nMIR and China's UnionPay are among the few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system in response to what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\\nEfforts by the West to close possible routes for circumventing sanctions continued on Thursday.\\n\\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, said it was deactivating the accounts of Russian nationals and companies based there that hold the equivalent of more than 10,000 euros ($10,900).\\nThose affected would still be able to withdraw their money but they will now be banned from making new deposits or trading, a move Binance said was in line with European Union sanctions. \\n \\n

       "14  (Reuters) -Russia's central bank will consider cutting its key interest rate further at upcoming board meetings, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday, flagging economic challenges the country faces as it tries to blunt the impact of Western sanctions over Ukraine. \\nNabiullina also said Russia is looking at adjustments to its foreign exchange controls to avoid situations where the rouble exchange rate deviates on a shadow market from official levels.\\nAs she begins her new five-year stint in charge of monetary policy, Nabiullina will have to deal with a full-scale economic crisis, tackling uncertainty stemming from Western sanctions.\\nThe central bank's emergency rate hike to 20% in late February helped stabilise the rouble and overcome a spike in inflation, Nabiullina said. The bank then cut the interest rate to 17% on April 8. Its next board meeting is on April 29.\\n\"We will consider the possibility of its further reduction at upcoming meetings,\" Nabiullina said, speaking in the lower house of parliament, the Duma. She did not say if a cut was likely at next week's meeting.\\nAndrei Kostin, head of Russia's second-largest lender VTB, which is targeted by Western sanctions, said on Thursday he expected the central bank to cut the key rate to 15% this month and to 12-13% by the end of the year, TASS news agency reported.\\nInflation in Russia now stands at 17.6% and is on track to accelerate to 22% this year, while the economy is set to shrink by 9.2% in 2022, according to a poll of economists conducted by the central bank in April.\\nNabiullina warned that Russia, which saw its strongest economic growth in 13 years in 2021, at 4.7%, will now undergo structural changes as its access to the global financial system and trade is limited by tough Western sanctions.\\n\"Problems may arise even when there is a production with a high degree of localisation, when there has already been a fairly high import substitution,\" Nabiullina said.\\nFor example, she said, Russia produces its own paper but uses foreign bleaching agents, or urgently needs foreign-made packing materials for food stuff produced in Russia.\\n\"It all takes time,\" she said.\\nThe country is facing capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the West imposed sanctions on banks, businesses and individuals following what Moscow calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\\n\\nNabiullina also said Russia aims to extend the number of countries that accept Russia's Mir banking cards, an alternative to VISA and MasterCard which have joined other Western firms and suspended their operations in Russia.\\nMir and China's UnionPay are among the few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system as part of the sanctions.\\n \\n

       "15  (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen anticipates steps to get Russia to help pay for rebuilding war-ravaged Ukraine, while saying that any move to deploy confiscated Russian assets for that effort would need to be considered carefully.\\n“The rebuilding costs, ultimately, in Ukraine are going to be enormous,” Yellen said at a press conference in Washington Thursday. “And certainly looking to Russia -- one way or another -- to help provide some of what’s necessary for Ukraine to build is something I think we ought to be pursuing.”\\nYellen said she was “unclear” whether, for the U.S., using sequestered Russian assets for Ukraine would require congressional legislation authorizing such use.\\n“That is a very significant step, and it’s one we would carefully need to think through the consequences of before undertaking it. I wouldn’t want to do so lightly,” Yellen said. American allies and partners would “need to feel comfortable with and be supportive of” such a move, she added.\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.

       "16  By Daphne Psaledakis and David Brunnstrom\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on dozens of people and entities, including a Russian commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company, hoping to target Moscow's evasion of existing sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said it designated a virtual currency mining company for the first time, alongside more than 40 people, and entities led by U.S.-designated Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.\\n“Treasury can and will target those who evade, attempt to evade, or aid the evasion of U.S. sanctions against Russia, as they are helping support Putin’s brutal war of choice,” Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in a statement. \\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \\nThe United States and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/byvrjenzmve on Moscow since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, including targeting the country's largest lenders and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. \\nWednesday's move targets Russia's virtual currency mining industry, reportedly the third largest in the world, sanctioning the holding company of Moscow-based bitcoin miner BitRiver, which operates a data center in Siberia, and 10 of the holding company's Russia-based subsidiaries. \\nIn a statement, Igor Runets, the founder and chief executive of BitRiver, said his company has \"never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington's sanctions.\"\\n\"These U.S. actions should obviously be viewed as interference in the crypto mining industry, unfair competition and an attempt to change the global balance of power in favor of American companies,\" Runets said. \\nThe Treasury also put sanctions on Russian commercial bank Transkapitalbank, whose representatives it said serve several banks in Asia, including in China, and the Middle East, and have suggested options to evade international sanctions.\\nIts subsidiary, Investtradebank, was also designated.\\nWednesday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\\nBut Washington issued two general licenses related to Transkapitalbank alongside the sanctions, authorizing the wind down of dealings with the bank until May 20 and certain transactions destined for or originating from Afghanistan until Oct. 20 \"in support of efforts to address the humanitarian crisis.\"\\nThe United States also imposed additional sanctions on Russian oligarch Malofeyev, whom U.S. authorities have long accused of being one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea. He was first designated under the Obama administration in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea.\\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department charged Malofeyev with violating sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.\\n\"The United States will work to ensure that the sanctions we have imposed, in close coordination with our international partners, degrade the Kremlin’s ability to project power and fund its invasion,\" Nelson said.\\nThe U.S. State Department is also imposing visa restrictions on over 600 people in a bid to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, barring them from traveling to the United States.\\n\\nThree Russian officials were also hit with visa restrictions over \"gross violations of human rights\" alongside 17 others hit with restrictions over accusations of undermining democracy in Belarus.\\n\"We will use every tool to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "17  The war in Ukraine has shown the limitations of the decades-long German approach of seeking to change Russia through trade and spells the end of globalisation as we know it, the European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday.\\nSpeaking at the Peterson Institute in Washington, Gentiloni said the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 would also reshape global alliances and put further strain on global supply chains, already fragile after two years of the pandemic.\\n\"The notion of 'Wandel durch Handel', of bringing about change through trade, has shown its limitations,\" Gentiloni said, referring to Germany's policy towards Eastern European states started in the early 1970s. \"We need to rethink our relations with autocratic regimes and strengthen our ties with like-minded partners,\" he said.\\nFor decades Germany has pursued close economic ties with Moscow, making itself heavily dependent on Russian gas, oil and coal in a policy that now makes it difficult for Europe to stop buying Russian energy and therefore stop indirectly financing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\"This crisis will also spell the end of globalisation as we have known it and reshape global alliances,\" Gentiloni said.\\n\"The war and its consequences – including the successive rounds of sanctions that the EU and the US have imposed on Russia – are exacerbating pressures on already strained global supply chains,\" he said.\\nGentiloni said the invasion also forced the 27-nation European Union to sharply boost spending on defence, on top of the already large planned investment on fighting climate change and adapting the economy to the digital age.\\nThis expenditure might need to be reflected in EU fiscal rules that are now under review, he said, and possibly in some new joint borrowing, possibly modelled on the EU's post-pandemic recovery fund of 800 billion euros of joint debt.\\n\"We are talking about mobilising hundreds of billions of additional investments each year. While most of these investments will need to come from the private sector, financing them will require a more supportive framework of fiscal rules and potentially new tools at the European level,\" he said.\\n\\nGermany and several other northern European countries are strongly opposed to such new joint borrowing. \\nGentiloni said the cost of the Ukraine war for Europe would depend on how long it lasts, but that economic and material support to Ukraine, assistance to refugees, as well as continued support to the EU economy to deal with high energy prices and disruptions in production will boost the aggregated EU budget deficit by at least 0.6% of GDP this year. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "18  Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina will have to deal with a full-scale economic crisis, tackling unprecedented uncertainty stemming from Western sanctions, as she begins her new five-year stint in charge of monetary policy.\\nA majority of lawmakers in the Russian lower house of parliament voted on Thursday in favour of Nabiullina's reappointment as central bank chief, supporting the choice made by President Vladimir Putin.\\nNabiullina will now have to steer the commodity-dependent economy through its steepest contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, fighting inflation that accelerated this month to a 20-year high of 17.62%.\\nNabiullina told lawmakers on Thursday that her priority task was to secure the availability of financial resources for an imminent structural transformation of the economy.\\n\"Our task is to ensure that our economy is competitive. In my view, we don't need to pursue the policy of self-isolation in all directions,\" the 58-year-old central bank veteran told the lower house of parliament, the Duma.\\n\"Combating inflation is also the most important task, that no one has abandoned.\" \\nThe central bank will consider cutting the key interest rate from 17% at upcoming board meetings, Nabiullina said, repeating her intention to return inflation to its 4% target by 2024 and flagging the economic challenges Russia will face.\\n\"Nabiullina is facing another challenging term, no doubt,\" said Tatiana Orlova, lead emerging market economist at Oxford Economics.\\nThere are several challenges the central bank will have to deal with, including when and how to lift capital controls, as well as the possible need to recapitalise some Russian banks.\\n\"So in short, the CBR Governor has her work cut out for her. I wouldn't want to be in her shoes right now,\" Orlova said.\\nNabiullina, an economist and former Kremlin adviser who became the first woman to chair the Bank of Russia, has strong support from Putin who has repeatedly praised her in the role since appointing her in 2013.\\nWidely respected as one of the world's top central bankers, partly for her efforts to rein in inflation, Nabiullina was targeted by sanctions in April as part of sweeping Western penalties against Russia for what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24.\\nSanctions have also frozen nearly half of Russia's $640 billion in gold and FX reserves controlled by the central bank, spurred capital flight from Russia and pushed it towards a possible debt default, while denting the country's access to the global trade and financial systems.\\n\"Hence the CBR will have a task of rebuilding the country’s FX buffer, in the meantime facing the challenge of investing it into assets that would be well-protected from seizure by the U.S. and its allies,\" Orlova said.\\n\\nAdopting to new economic realities where well-established trading links with other countries are damaged will also be on the central bank's radar.\\n\"We need to move forward... Sanctions have now disrupted normal payments for goods and services, many companies have encountered that. And the priority is international settlements for companies and citizens,\" Nabiullina said. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "20  By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Nikolaj Skydsgaard\\nCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to the Russian market, expects its decision to sell its business there to result in a writedown of about 9.5 billion Danish crowns ($1.39 billion), it said on Thursday.\\nThe company, which has eight breweries and 8,400 employees in Russia, said late last month that it would sell its business in the country, joining an exodus of Western companies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe writedown did not take into account any external offers for the business and was subject to a \"very high degree of volatility and uncertainty\", Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said, adding that the sale could take up to 12 months. \\nIn addition, Carlsberg reported a currency loss adjustment to its Russian business worth 4 billion crowns triggered by a recent depreciation of the Russian rouble. \\nDutch rival Heineken (OTC:HEINY) has also said it will exit Russia and last month said it expected to book related charges of about 400 million euros ($437 million).\\nCarlsberg had non-current assets in Russia worth 19.2 billion Danish crowns by the end of 2021, its annual report said. \\n\"The writedown isn't quite as grim as one might have feared,\" Sydbank analyst Per Fogh told Reuters. \\n\"This is what they consider to be fair value of the asset now, but the question still remains what a potential buyer would pay for it.\"\\nCarlsberg last year generated 10% of its revenue and 6% of its operating profit in Russia, where it took full control of the Baltika group of breweries in 2008. \\nSince then, however, it has faced sluggish sales in a sanctions-hit economy while facing Russian regulations aimed at curbing alcohol abuse.\\nCarlsberg lowered its operating profit growth forecast for this year to between minus 5% and plus 2%, compared with previous guidance of 0% and 7%.\\nShares in Carlsberg, which have shed nearly a quarter of their value since the start of the year, fell slightly on the news but were up 1% by 1026 GMT. \\n\\nThe brewer said it also expected 300 million crowns of Ukraine impairment charges along with goodwill writedowns of 700 million crowns for the Central and Eastern Europe region, which includes Ukraine. \\n($1 = 6.8196 Danish crowns)\\n \\n

       "21  Britain hopes to complete a free trade deal with India by the end of this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday as he emphasised the need to reduce reliance on foreign oil and gas due to the conflict in Ukraine. \\n\"We're hoping to complete another free trade agreement with India by the end of the year, by the autumn,\" Johnson told reporters in India's western state of Gujarat during the start of his two-day visit to the country. \\nIndia abstained in a UN vote condemning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, causing concern among major western countries. \\nBut Johnson's office had said before his visit that he would not lecture Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. Moscow has called the war a \"special operation.\" \\n\"India and Russia have, historically, a very different relationship, perhaps than Russia and the UK have had over the last couple of decades. We have to reflect that reality but clearly I'll be talking about it to Narendra Modi,\" Johnson said.\\nIndia imports defence equipment and oil from Russia.\\n\\n\"India and the UK both share anxieties about autocracies around the world. We're both democracies, and we want to stick together,\" Johnson said, stressing the need to move away from relying on foreign hydrocarbons. \\n\"One of the things that we're talking about is what we can do to build partnerships on hydrogen, on electric vehicles, on offshore wind... there's also the opportunity for us to deepen our security and defence partnership.\" \\n \\n

       "24  The global travel and tourism sectors are projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and grow at a rate that will outpace global gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said on Thursday.\\nThe industry is expected to post an annual average growth rate of 5.8% from 2022 to 2032 versus the 2.7% increase in global GDP, and create 126 million new jobs, WTTC said in a report released during the industry group's conference in Manila.\\nIn 2019, tourism accounted for a tenth of global GDP and jobs but the coronavirus pandemic decimated the $9.6 trillion industry, halving its output value and leaving 62 million people jobless.\\n\"The recovery is going to be so stellar that it's going to recover really powerfully. This does depend of course on China reopening,\" said WTTC President Julia Simpson, calling on all governments to reopen borders.\\nChina's \"zero COVID\" policy and persistent lockdowns have disrupted global trade and domestic and international travel.\\nThe travel and tourism industry's GDP is seen hitting $8.35 trillion this year and $9.6 trillion in 2023, a return to its pre-pandemic level.\\nTourism jobs are projected to recover to 300 million this year and 324 million in 2023, close to the 333 million seen in 2019, WTTC said.\\n\\nIn Asia-Pacific alone, the hospitality industry's GDP will likely hit $3.4 trillion in 2023, already above the $3.3 trillion it saw in 2019, it said.\\nCompared with North America and Europe, travel has trailed in Asia-Pacific because of strict border restrictions in many countries. In Southeast Asia, travellers are now getting back on planes as the region's entry and COVID-19 quarantine rules are lifted. But a full recovery will be slow, industry members say. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

It cited Siluanov as calling on the G20 not to politicize dialogue between members and stressing the grouping had always focused on the economy.\\nHe also complained about the damaging effect of Western sanctions, the statement said.\\n\"Another aspect of the current crisis is the undermining of confidence in the existing international monetary and financial system,\" it said. \"The safety of international reserves and the possibility of free trade and financial transactions are no longer guaranteed.\"\\nLagarde urged Maksimov to convey to Moscow a clear message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "26  By Leika Kihara\\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan explained to its G7 counterparts the yen's recent \"somewhat rapid\" declines, finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday, underscoring Tokyo's growing alarm over the currency's sharp fall to a two-decade low against the dollar.\\nSuzuki did not comment on how the G7 finance leaders responded, saying only that the meeting in Washington, D.C., focused on discussions over the global economy and Russia's invasion of Ukraine rather than exchange-rate moves.\\nIn a statement issued after their meeting, the leaders said they were closely monitoring global financial markets that have been \"volatile,\" but made no direct mention of exchange rates.\\nSuzuki said the G7 likely stuck to its agreement that markets ought to determine currency rates, that the group will closely coordinate on currency moves, and that excessive and disorderly exchange-rate moves would hurt growth.\\n\"I believe the G7's basic thinking on exchange rates remains intact,\" Suzuki told reporters after the meeting with finance leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies, held on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gatherings.\\nMarkets are focusing on Suzuki's meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expected later this week.\\nThe yen slightly extended losses from earlier in the day, falling to 128.63 yen per dollar just after the remarks, but was still off a 20-year low of 129.40 hit on Wednesday.\\nThe currency has plunged against the dollar, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continuing to defend its ultra-low rate policy in contrast with heightening chances of aggressive rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\\nInvestors believe the yen has even further to fall, with most betting that even a government intervention wouldn't be enough to turn around the momentum.\\nHighlighting the difficulty Tokyo may face if it sought global consent to intervene, a senior IMF official told Reuters the yen's recent declines have been driven by fundamentals with no sign of disorderly exchange-rate moves.\\n\"The finance ministry will find it hard to intervene and probably continue jawboning markets,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management.\\n\"The BOJ isn't in charge of currency policy, so will focus on achieving its price goal by maintaining a loose monetary policy.\"\\n\\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who also attended the G7 meeting, said excessive exchange-rate volatility could affect business activity.\\n\"The BOJ will carefully watch how currency moves could affect Japan's economy and prices,\" he said.\\n \\n

       "27  By Steve Holland\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $800 million in more weaponry for Ukraine on Thursday and said he would ask Congress for more money to help bolster support for the Ukrainian military as it faces a fresh onslaught by Russia on its eastern flank. \\nAddressing Americans from the White House's Roosevelt Room, Biden pledged to send heavy artillery, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as tactical drones, as he called on Congress for supplemental funding to provide additional aid for Kyiv.\\nBiden also announced $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government as it battles to save the lives of people under siege by Russian forces.\\n\"We’re in a critical window now of time where they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said, referring to Russia's tactical shift to the east. The United States and allies are “moving as fast as possible” to provide Ukraine with the equipment and weapons it needs.\\nBiden said the new assistance will expend most of the remaining funds available for this purpose and that he will make a supplemental funding request to Congress next week. He said the amount is being discussed.\\n\"That’s being decided now. I’m asking the Defense Department to put together a proposal,\" he said.\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives will consider the additional aid for Ukraine as soon as next week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. There is strong support among Democrats and Republicans for assisting Ukraine. \\nThe Pentagon said that the new package would include 75 155mm long-range howitzers, 72 tactical vehicles to tow them, and more than 100 Phoenix Ghost drones.\\nBiden spoke after face-to-face talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who is in Washington for a variety of meetings.\\nThe president announced plans to ban Russian-affiliated ships from docking at U.S. ports, as previously reported by Reuters, further ratcheting up pressure on Moscow. A senior administration official said the move was aimed at further isolating Russia. \\nBiden also said his administration will allow Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their home country to come to the United States temporarily if they have American sponsors, a move that could affect thousands of refugees.\\nThe new arms package is the same size as an $800 million one announced last week \\nBiden said the new weapons are needed as Ukraine battles a major offensive from Russia in the east, where the flatter terrain requires a different set of weaponry.\\nOn Wednesday, he convened U.S. military leaders in an annual White House gathering that took on special significance as the war enters a risky new phase. \\nRussia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to \"liberate\" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Western allies anticipate Russia's campaign could last many months, grind to a stalemate and test the battlefield capabilities of Ukrainian fighters.\\nBiden disputed Russian claims of control of the embattled city of Mariupol, saying that \"there's no evidence that Mariupol has completely fallen.\" He added that Russia \"should allow humanitarian corridors to let people at that steel mill and other places (that) are buried under rubble to get out.\"\\nRussia says it launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24 to demilitarize and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. \\nU.S. forces are not fighting in Ukraine but are indirectly engaged, arming, training and financing its forces.\\n\\nThe U.S. aid announced last week included artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, broadening the scope of materiel sent to Kyiv to include new types of heavy equipment.\\nAdding this week's package brings total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded to well over $3 billion.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "28  As Russia teeters on the brink of a historic default, foreign investors in the country's debt have few palatable options to recover their money: bet on costly legal action, trust bilateral agreements will stand, or sit on their hands. \\nForeign creditors would typically try to band together to negotiate, go to court or in some cases seek arbitration in cases of default, but Western sanctions in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and the peculiarities of Russian sovereign bonds make those options hard at the moment, lawyers said.\\nSome $40 billion of Russian sovereign debt issued in dollars and euros is outstanding, with about half of that held by foreigners. Under terms of most of that debt, Moscow must pay investors in the currency in which the bonds are denominated. \\nWestern sanctions cut off Moscow’s access to some $300 billion in gold and foreign currency reserves it held in banks abroad. That means Moscow must either use whatever hard currency it has at home to pay investors, or default on its obligations.\\nRussia says it has the money and is willing to pay but cannot do so because of the sanctions imposed in response to what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. It said it would use its own currency if it cannot pay in foreign currency until its reserves are unfrozen.\\nIt has made a $649 million payment that was due on April 4 on two of its bonds in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the debt, a move a derivatives watchdog ruled a \"potential failure to pay\". \\nRating agencies have said Russia may be in default because the payment must be made in dollars or due to a perceived lack of willingness to repay, with S&P lowering its foreign currency ratings to \"selective default\".\\nOnce a 30-day grace period to the April 4 bond payments passes in early May, investors would have three options, said Dennis Hranitzky, head of sovereign litigation at law firm Quinn Emanuel. \\nThey could wait and see what happens, take legal action against Russia in court, or seek arbitration under bilateral treaties that Russia has with dozens of countries, he said.\\nWith the situation around sanctions changing as the war rages on, the first option is the most likely one, said Hranitzky and other lawyers who are in touch with bondholders.\\n\"I don't think we know enough about how this is going to unfold, we don't know how long the war is going to last,\" said Hranitzky.\\nLEGAL ACTION\\nThe situation with Russia is unprecedented. \\nOne lawyer said the closest historical parallels, where geopolitics are the main driving force in a potential default scenario, are when U.S. President Jimmy Carter cut off Iran's oil sales and froze its assets abroad in response to the 1979 hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, and when Britain encouraged banks to declare Argentina in default in the wake of the 1982 Falklands/Malvinas war.\\nIn both cases, the crisis eventually abated as did the political pressure, said veteran debt lawyer Lee Buchheit.\\n\"It's been 40 years since we have seen anything quite like this,\" said Buchheit, who has worked on such sovereign debt restructurings as Greece and Argentina. \"This is not a financial problem; it is a pure political one.\" \\nBondholders can try to take matters to court but this is often a costly and lengthy process aimed at either getting compensation or seizing assets. In the case of Russia, legal action will be even more fraught, the lawyers said.\\nFor one, the contracts of the bonds in question do not define a jurisdiction in case of a dispute, which will make it more challenging for bondholders to decide on the venue they use to sue.\\nLawyers also expect Moscow to mount a defense blaming sanctions for its inability to pay after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia would take legal action if the West forces it to default. \\nThe bond contract is bound by English law, under which the argument of frustration of purpose could be made, meaning that Moscow could argue that it tried to pay but the West wouldn’t let it because of the sanctions.\\n\"Russia is going to argue this,\" said Mitu Gulati, a law professor at the University of Virginia and expert on debt restructurings. However, he expected Moscow would have limited success. \"Yes, this is a war, but it is a war caused by Russia.\"\\nAnother option for investors would be to seek arbitration directly against Russia. An investor-state arbitration allows creditors from jurisdictions with bilateral investment treaties to bring claims and seek monetary damages and other relief directly against the state.\\nRussia has dozens of such treaties, including with most of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\\n\\nAn arbitration award like that could be enforced in U.S. courts, said Hranitzky, whose firm also represents Ukraine's government in financial disputes with Russia.\\n\"The nightmare scenario is that the situation in Ukraine is not resolved and sanctions remain in place for months, maybe longer,\" Buchheit said. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "30  By Dominique Vidalon\\nPARIS (Reuters) -France's  Carrefour  (EPA:CARR) said on Wednesday it looked to 2022 with confidence after its sales growth accelerated in the first quarter, driven mostly by Brazil, its second-largest market.\\nIn an inflationary environment made worse by the Ukraine crisis, Carrefour would protect the purchasing power of customers and at the same time reinforce its economic model, its finance chief Matthieu Malige told analysts.\\nTo do so, the French retailer said it would rely on its Carrefour branded products, promotional activities and loyalty programmes while also stepping up cost savings.\\nEurope's largest food retailer reiterated a target to generate free cash flow above 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2022 and with cost inflation accelerating, it said it now aimed for more than 900 million euros in cost savings this year.\\nCash is key to the French food retailer's plans to step up its digital commerce expansion.\\nThe firm also said that having achieved 400 million euros on the 750 million euros share buyback programme it announced in February, it would launch the second tranche in the coming days.\\nHYPER TENSION\\nCarrefour reported that its first quarter sales reached 20.239 billion euros ($22 billion), marking like-for-like growth of 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Brazil and Spain while in the core French market sales were flat. This was an acceleration from 0.7% sales growth for the group in the fourth quarter 2021.\\nBut sales at French hypermarkets, whose revival has been a priority for Carrefour boss Alexandre Bompard, fell 1.1% in the quarter compared with a 1.3% decline in the fourth quarter 2021.\\n\"This highlights the weakness of the format given that lower pricing of the hyper format should benefit in the current inflationary environment,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.\\nCarrefour is in the last leg of a five-year plan begun in 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment to improve profit and sales, as it battles online rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and discounters like Lidl and unlisted Leclerc.\\nBompard, who was reappointed in May 2021 for another three years, is working on a new strategic plan and an asset review.\\n\\nCarrefour shares have gained 27% so far this year, but still trade 7% below when Bompard took over in July 2017.\\n($1 = 0.9212 euros) \\n \\n

With the world (and energy policy) now turned on its head, we believe XOM has two key advantages relative to peers 1) it is the largest refiner among the majors; and 2) it screens well on upstream portfolio longevity, an area we expect to be under increased scrutiny in a high commodity price environment,” Borkhataria said in a client note.\\nBorkhataria argues that the earnings momentum will continue fueled by refining tailwinds. On the other hand,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) shares are downgraded to Sector Perform from Outperform with a $165.00 per share price target (up from $160.00).\\nThe analyst sees a more balanced risk-reward at current levels.\\n“CVX has rallied more than any other major in recent months, and we believe part of this has been a ‘safety trade’ alongside strong commodity prices… While we expect commodity prices to remain strong, we think the current valuation leaves less room for positive surprise, while headwinds with Tengizrealisations could weigh on earnings relative to peers,” Borkhataria added.\\nChevron stock price is down 0.4% today.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic

       "33  Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) cut its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday, hurt by the pullback of its Russian operations, higher costs and a sluggish recovery in its Asian duty-free business. \\nThe tobacco giant took a charge of 3 cents per share related to the war in Ukraine in the first quarter, after discontinuing sales of a number of Marlboro and Parliament cigarette products in Russia.\\nThe company, which is working on options to exit Russia, has also canceled product launches for the year and suspended its planned investments there following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. \\nPhilip Morris' first-quarter earnings fell 3.6% to $2.32 billion, or $1.50 per share, including the 3-cent charge.\\nRussia generated revenue of more than $1.8 billion last

       "34  Nestle's organic growth target of around 5% this year is \"conservative\" while the margin target has become more challenging due to inflationary pressures, the food group's chief executive said on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Our start into the year was stronger than expected, and we believe that our organic sales growth guidance is conservative at this point,\" Mark Schneider said in a call on the group's first-quarter sales.\\n\"At the same time, inflationary pressures have increased a lot since then and in ways that were not foreseeable at that time. As a result of this change in context, our guidance range of 17% to 17.5% for the underlying trading operating profit margin has become more challenging than before when we described it as conservative,\" he said. \\n \\n

       "37  Today, Amazon announced Buy with Prime—a new benefit for Prime members that will extend the convenience of Prime shopping to online stores beyond Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Buy with Prime will initially be available by invitation only for merchants using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and will roll out through 2022 as merchants are invited to participate, including those not selling on Amazon or using FBA.\\nExpanded Shopping Benefits for Prime Members\\nBuy with Prime will allow millions of U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants’ online stores with the trusted experience they expect from Amazon—including fast, free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and free returns on eligible orders. Prime members will see the Prime logo and delivery promise on eligible products in merchants’ online stores, which signals the item is available for free delivery, as fast as next day, with free returns. When shopping with Buy with Prime, checkout is simple and convenient. Prime members will use the payment and shipping information stored in their Amazon account and receive timely shipping and delivery notifications after an order is placed.\\n“We always aim to exceed Prime members’ expectations by offering more selection, exclusive deals, quality content, and convenient features,” said Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “With the introduction of Buy with Prime, we’re expanding where members can enjoy trusted and convenient Prime shopping benefits beyond Amazon, adding even more value to their membership. Members will have the flexibility to shop from merchants directly, all while enjoying the fast, free delivery, seamless checkout, and easy returns they’ve come to know and love from Amazon.”\\nA New Way for Merchants to Grow their Online Stores\\n“For over 20 years, we’ve been empowering small and medium-sized businesses with opportunities to grow,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon’s vice president of Buy with Prime. “Allowing merchants to offer Prime shopping benefits on their own direct-to-consumer online stores is an exciting next step in our mission to help merchants of all sizes grow their business—whether on Amazon or beyond. With shoppers purchasing directly from merchants’ online stores, Buy with Prime will allow merchants to build customer relationships and brand loyalty while offering conversion-driving benefits like fast, free shipping.”\\nFor merchants already using FBA, Buy with Prime can be added to their online store within minutes because their inventory is already stored in Amazon fulfillment centers. To get started, merchants sign up for Buy with Prime, link an Amazon Seller Central account, use Multi-Channel Fulfillment to offer one pool of inventory for multiple channels, and link an Amazon Pay account to offer a seamless checkout experience for Prime members. Then, by installing a JavaScript widget in their online store, merchants can easily add Buy with Prime to one or more products. With Buy with Prime, merchants will receive shopper order information, including email addresses for customer orders, which they can use to provide customer service and build direct relationships with shoppers.\\nUsing Buy with Prime, merchants simply pay for what they use. Pricing is based on a service fee, a payment processing fee, and fulfillment and storage fees that are calculated per unit. With no fixed subscription fee or long-term contract required, merchants can expand selection or cancel at any time.\\n“Buy with Prime will be a game changer for our brand. Prime members will enjoy the trust and familiarity they have with shopping on Amazon while connecting with our business directly on our own site,” said David Ghiyam, president of MaryRuth Organics. “When we began using Fulfillment by Amazon, our business quadrupled in growth thanks to Amazon’s logistics network and our Prime-eligible listings. Using Buy with Prime, we will be able to drive the conversion we’ve experienced with Fulfillment by Amazon while running our business on our own site.”\\nBuy with Prime is designed to work with most online stores, including ecommerce service providers such as BigCommerce. “Buy with Prime represents a compelling value-add for BigCommerce merchants who wish to increase their sales and optimize the omnichannel experience they provide their customers,” said Troy Cox, senior vice president of product at BigCommerce. “Prime set the bar for a shopping experience customers trust, including convenient and fast shipping. As one of the top ecommerce platforms collaborating with Amazon to add Buy with Prime, extending these benefits to our merchants will help elevate their online shopper experiences, build brand loyalty, and power them to grow and scale.\"\\nLearn more about Buy with Prime: https://buywithprime.amazon.com/\\nAbout Amazon\\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

       "38  By David Shepardson\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday appealed a judge's ruling ending a mask mandate on public transportation and airplanes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the measure was still needed. \\nA U.S. district judge ruled on Monday that the mandates, which apply to planes, trains and other public transportation, were unlawful. The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling if the CDC determined the 14-month-old mandate was still needed.\\nThe Justice Department filed notice appealing the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court, but did not detail if it intended to seek an emergency order to reinstate the requirement or detail the grounds for the appeal.\\nThe CDC said on Wednesday it had asked the Justice Department to proceed with the appeal and that \"an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health.\"\\nAirlines quickly dropped the mandate Monday evening soon after the White House informed reporters and industry officials that the government would no longer enforce the mandate. Social media users posted videos of airline employees on some trips announcing the mandate had ended mid-flight with many cheering the news, while some expressed anger that the mask rules were abruptly dropped.\\nThe mandate applied to planes, trains, ride-share vehicles and other public transportation and, prior to Monday's ruling, had been due to expire on May 3 unless the CDC sought a new extension.\\nThe U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that \"masks were critically important during the height of the pandemic\" but in the current environment \"required masking on public transportation is simply out of step with the current public health landscape.\"\\n\\nThe ruling followed other court judgments against Biden administration directives to fight the infectious disease that has killed nearly 1 million Americans, including vaccination or COVID testing mandates for employers.\\nThe CDC also lost court battles on COVID-19 mandates, notably when the Supreme Court in August ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions.\\n \\n

       "40  Several Russian banks plan to issue payment cards that use the network of China UnionPay as well as that of home-grown payment system Mir, after  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and MasterCard Inc joined other Western firms in suspending operations in Russia.\\nUnionPay and Mir are among few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\".\\nWhereas many Western nations have condemned Russia's conduct, ally China has refrained from direct criticism, effectively allowing Chinese companies such as UnionPay to continue business as usual with Russian partners.\\nSeveral Russian lenders already issue cards with UnionPay. Still, the Chinese payment service is wary of cooperating with sanctioned Russian banks for fear that could lead to itself being sanctioned, the RBC business daily reported on Wednesday, citing five unidentified people at major Russian banks.\\nUnionPay did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\\nWHAT IS UNIONPAY?\\nChina approved the central bank's creation of UnionPay as a coalition of banking operators in 2002 to allow domestic inter-bank transactions and settlements across different platforms.\\nFunded by the government and China's largest commercial lenders, UnionPay clears and settles payments directly with banks and licensed lenders by issuing debit, credit and prepaid cards.\\nIt has 87 shareholders including affiliates of the People's Bank of China, commercial lenders such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp, and rural credit providers.\\nIt enjoyed a monopoly before China allowed foreign payment networks to set up onshore operations in 2020, and in recent years has rapidly expanded overseas.\\nUnionPay ranked first by number of cards in circulation worldwide as at the end of 2021 with 9.4 billion, showed data from researcher Nilson. Visa had 3.7 billion and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) 2.5 billion.\\nHOW HAS IT GROWN INTERNATIONALLY?\\nIncreased Chinese tourism spurred UnionPay to build offshore ties with banks and merchants, first in Hong Kong in 2004 and United States in 2005.\\nIn 2012, UnionPay founded overseas arm UnionPay International which has formed partnerships with over 2,500 institutions worldwide, making the card accepted in 180 territories, UnionPay's website showed.\\nUnionPay cards are issued in over 70 countries and regions, it said.\\nIts expansion has involved several European financial firms including HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC, Travelex and Moneycorp. UnionPay card holders can withdraw sterling in Britain from Barclays and Travelex cash machines.\\nHolders of UnionPay cards issued by HSBC can also make withdrawals from that bank's cash machines in Britain.\\nUnionPay is fast catching up with global competitors in absolute volume processed, benefiting largely from the rising purchasing power of Chinese buyers domestically and overseas.\\nAbout 40% of global card purchase transaction volume was through Visa in 2020, but UnionPay is a close second at 32%, followed by MasterCard at 24%, Nilson data showed.\\nHOW BIG IS UNIONPAY IN RUSSIA?\\nOver 55 million merchants globally accept UnionPay cards as of March 2021. Acceptance coverage is 95% in Russia where over 1.6 million point-of-sale terminals support UnionPay QuickPass payment technology, UnionPay statements showed. More than 4 million UnionPay cards have been issued in Russia, it said.\\nThe high penetration rate has prompted Russian banks to turn to UnionPay after Western nations imposed an array of sanctions.\\n\\nNational Bank of Ukraine (NBU), a UnionPay partner, publicly asked UnionPay to stop processing transactions in Russia and those involving cards issued by Russian banks and used abroad.\\n\"We kindly ask you to make a contribution into restoring peace in Ukraine and cease your operation in the Russian Federation,\" NBU Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko said in a March 17 statement. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "43  By David Shepardson\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday it plans to restore flight privileges to about 2,000 customers who were barred from flights after failing to comply with mask rules.\\nThe Biden administration on Monday said it would no longer enforce a U.S. mask mandate on public transportation and airlines after a federal judge struck down the directive as unlawful.\\nAtlanta-based Delta Reuters it will restore passengers \"only after each case is reviewed and each customer demonstrates an understanding of their expected behavior when flying with us. Any further disregard for the policies that keep us all safe will result in placement on Delta's permanent no-fly list.\"\\nThe change will not impact Delta's separate list of about 1,000 people \"who demonstrated egregious behavior and are already on the permanent no-fly list.\" \\nDelta's announcement follows a similar decision by United Airlines on Tuesday to allow some of the roughly 1,000 people who have been banned for not wearing masks to return to flights on a \"case by case basis.\" Chicago-based United said those people would be allowed to return to flights \"after ensuring their commitment to follow all crewmember instructions on board.\"\\nDelta said that of the 2,000 passengers barred over mask violations, \"any further disregard for the policies that keep us all safe will result in placement on Delta's permanent no-fly list.\" The airline has urged the Justice Department to back a federal permanent no-fly list for those who exhibit egregious or violent behavior. \\n\\nThe Justice Department said Wednesday it plans to appeal the order that forced the government to halt enforcement of the mask mandate.\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said separately on Wednesday that it plans to make a zero tolerance policy for unruly passengers adopted in January 2021 permanent.\\n( \\n

       "45  Brazil's ABPA, a lobby group representing large pork and chicken processors like  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) and BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS), said on Wednesday its member companies are facing difficulties shipping products through the Port of Shanghai. \\nThe statement, sent in response to a question from Reuters about the effects of the COVID lockdown in the Chinese city, said cargoes are being redirected to other ports, such as Yantian. \\n\"There are no reports of suspension of sales,\" the statement said, referring to rumors about potential contract cancellations. \"At the same time, ABPA member companies hope that the situation in Shanghai will soon return to normal.\"\\nStrict lockdown measures after a COVID-19 outbreak began in March, affecting 25 million Shanghai residents, hampering businesses and the circulation of goods.\\nAfter the lockdown was imposed, containers of frozen food began backing up at the port, with inspections for incoming meat halted.\\n\\nShanghai is the main point of entry for Brazilian meat imports to mainland China, which is Brazil's top trade partner.\\nLast week, Reuters reported at least one shipping line operator had stopped sending Brazilian meat to Shanghai, instead offering clients the alternative of sending cargo to Xingang and Ningbo. \\n \\n

       "47  By Nate Raymond and Gabriella Borter\\n(Reuters) -A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked Kentucky officials from enforcing a sweeping new abortion law that Planned Parenthood said would force abortion clinics to stop offering the procedure until they can meet certain requirements.\\nU.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings in Louisville issued a temporary restraining order https://tmsnrt.rs/3OrRFTg at Planned Parenthood's request a week after the Republican-led legislature overrode a veto by the state's Democratic governor to enact the law.\\nThe measure, HB 3, made Kentucky the first U.S. state without legal abortion access since the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade established the right to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable nationwide, abortion providers say.\\nPlanned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed separate lawsuits challenging the law, which calls for a combination birth-death or stillbirth certificate to be issued for each abortion and bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\\nJennings, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said because the law went into effect immediately, there was not enough time for related regulations governing abortion to be written that clinics must comply with.\\nThose clinics included a Planned Parenthood affiliate, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, that runs one of Kentucky's two remaining abortion clinics.\\n\"Because plaintiff cannot comply with HB 3 and thus cannot legally perform abortion services, its patients face a substantial obstacle to exercising their rights to a pre-viability abortion,\" she wrote.\\nJennings said she was not at this stage considering the constitutionality of the law's requirements and would consider at a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction whether any parts could be complied with.\\n\"This is a win, but it is only the first step,\" Rebecca Gibron, the Planned Parenthood affiliate's chief executive, said in a statement.\\nA spokesperson for Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment.\\nRepublican-led states this year have been rapidly passing anti-abortion legislation in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court will back a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi this spring.\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority and appeared open to rolling back or overturning Roe v. Wade during case arguments in December.\\nWhile only in effect for eight days, abortion rights advocates say the Kentucky law caused significant disruptions for women seeking abortions.\\n\\nThe Kentucky Health Justice Network, which provides financial assistance to patients seeking abortions, facilitated patients' travel to Indiana and Ohio to terminate pregnancies in the last week, said operations director Ashley Jacobs.\\n\"I am kind of shocked,\" she said of the ruling. \"It wasn't expected that this judge would be friendly to the injunction.\"\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "48  By Amy Tennery\\n(Reuters) -Thirteen unnamed sexual abuse survivors of Larry Nassar are seeking $130 million from the FBI over allegations that it botched the investigation into the former USA Gymnastics doctor, their lawyers said on Thursday.\\nThe individuals say they suffered further abuse as a result of the FBI's failure to properly investigate Nassar after being made aware of some of the accusations against him. Each is submitting an administrative tort claim.\\n\"This is the largest failure on the part of law enforcement in the history of the world as it pertains to the protection of children, and there must be institutional accountability to make sure this doesn’t happen again,\" attorney Jamie White said in a statement.\\nThe FBI responded to a request for comment by referring Reuters to remarks https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/dereliction-of-duty-examining-the-inspector-generals-report-on-the-fbis-handling-of-the-larry-nassar-investigation-091521 made by Director Christopher Wray before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in September.\\nThe U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog said in July that the FBI dragged its feet in probing sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who was sentenced in 2018 to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts in his care.\\nIt also accused two FBI officials of lying to cover up \"numerous and fundamental errors\" that allowed Nassar's abuse to continue.\\nMcKayla Maroney, a member of the Olympic gold medal-winning London 2012 team, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September that she spent three hours on the phone with the FBI in 2015 detailing her story, but that the law enforcement agency failed to document it for a year and a half and misrepresented her remarks.\\nAttorneys for the 13 individuals said the tort claims could be a precursor to a civil lawsuit and that the FBI has six months to respond.\\n\\n\"No one should have been assaulted after the summer of 2015, because the FBI should have done its job,\" Grace French, a Nassar survivor and founder of advocacy group The Army of Survivors, said in a statement. \\n\"To know that the FBI could have helped to avoid this trauma disgusts me,\" she

       "49  The port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, reduced to a wasteland littered with bodies by nearly two months of siege and bombardment that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of civilians, is a big strategic prize for Russia.\\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Thursday declared the city \"liberated\" after nearly two months of siege, despite leaving hundreds of defenders still holed up inside the giant Azovstal steel works.\\nHere is why the city matters so much:\\nSTRATEGIC LOCATION\\nMariupol, home to more than 400,000 people before the war, is the biggest Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov and the main port serving the industries and agriculture of eastern Ukraine. It is also the site of some of Ukraine's biggest metals plants.\\nOn the eve of the war, it was the biggest city still held by Ukrainian authorities in Luhansk or Donetsk, the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas that Moscow has demanded Ukraine cede to pro-Russian separatists.\\nControl of Mariupol means Russia commands the entire coastline of the Sea of Azov, and has a secure overland route linking the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, with mainland Russia and the parts of eastern Ukraine held by separatists.\\nIt links up two of the main axes of Russia's invasion, and frees Russian forces to join the main offensive being waged against the bulk of Ukraine's army in the east.\\nControl of Mariupol could also give Russia a stronger position to negotiate at any peace talks.\\nAZOV BATTALION\\nProminent among the Ukrainian forces that have defended Mariupol is the Azov Battalion, a nationalist militia started by far-right volunteers after Russian-backed separatists took control of parts of the eastern Donbas region in 2014.\\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin on Thursday that Mariupol had symbolic importance because it was what he called the de facto headquarters of the Azov Battalion.\\nRussia has said the destruction of that group is one of its main war aims as it tries to \"denazify\" Ukraine. Kyiv says the unit has been reformed and incorporated into the National Guard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "50  By Daniel Trotta\\n(Reuters) -Like Batman forming the Justice League of superheroes, or Iron Man helping assemble the Avengers, comic book editor Scott Dunbier needed to put together a team of stars.\\nThe call went out and Dunbier quickly signed up the biggest names in the U.S. comic book industry to collaborate on a special anthology to raise money for Ukrainian war refugees.\\nThe result is \"Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds,\" a 96-page book produced by the best writers, artists, colorists, letterers, designers and editors that Dunbier could find.\\nProceeds, estimated to reach $200,000 to $500,000, will go to Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based disaster relief agency raising money for Ukrainian war refugees. Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.\\nBy Thursday, three days after launching, it had raised $78,000 on the Zoop crowdfunding site https://zoop.gg/c/comicsforukraine. The publication date remains uncertain, depending on how much is raised through pre-orders after a month, Dunbier said.\\nAs many comic books do, the Ukraine project has an origin story.\\n\"It was basically me being glued to my TV watching the horror, the atrocities unfold, and just feeling like I had to do something. And, you know, then it clicked.

       "52  Child vaccination rates in the United States fell during the COVID-19 pandemic as many children skipped doctors appointments and states eased vaccine requirements during remote learning, according to a government study released on Thursday.\\nDuring the 2020–21 school year, vaccination coverage among kindergartners nationwide for three required vaccines was approximately 1% lower than the previous school year, according to the study conducted by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\n\"As schools return to in-person learning, high vaccination coverage is necessary to continue protecting students from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" the study's authors said. \\nThe researchers looked at coverage for three commonly required vaccines: the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella; DTaP, which prevents diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis; and the varicella shot for chickenpox.\\nCoverage for all three vaccines decreased in a majority of states to about 94%, just under the target of 95%, the CDC said.\\n“This might not sound like much,\" Georgina Peacock, acting director of CDC’s Immunization Services Division told reporters on a call. \"But it amounts to at least 35,000 more children across the United States that entered kindergarten without documentation of complete vaccination against common diseases like measles, whooping cough, and chickenpox.” \\n\\nThe study included data collected for the 2020–21 school year by state and local immunization programs in 47 states and the District of Columbia.\\nThe study authors noted some limitations to their data, including variations in states' vaccine requirements and documentation processes, non-inclusion of three states and barriers created by the pandemic, such as the shift to virtual learning. \\n \\n

       "59  President Joe Biden convened U.S. military leaders on Wednesday in an annual White House gathering taking on special significance as the war in Ukraine enters a risky new phase and Washington plans more weapons assistance.\\nA \"variety of topics\" were set to be discussed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and senior military leaders, a National Security Council spokesperson said. The event includes a formal West Wing meeting as well as a dinner in the president's residence with leaders' spouses afterward. \\nWhile the annual military policy meeting rarely makes news, weighty issues are on the agenda this year, topped by a conflict in Ukraine that officials fear could imperil European security for years to come. \\nRussia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to \"liberate\" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Western allies anticipate Russia's campaign could last many months, grind to a stalemate and test the battlefield capabilities of Ukrainian fighters.\\nOpening the meeting, Biden touted the toughness of the Ukrainian military and said that NATO's unity has shocked Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\"They're tougher and more proud than I thought; I'm amazed what they're doing with your help,\" Biden said. \"I don't think that Putin counted on it being able to hold us together.\"\\nThe United States is expected to announce another military aid package for Ukraine in coming days that could match the $800 million pledged last week.\\nRussia says it launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24 to demilitarize and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. \\nU.S. forces are not fighting in Ukraine but are indirectly engaged, arming, training and financing Kyiv's forces. \\nA lengthy clash could also test U.S. public support for Washington's backing of Ukraine. Last month, Biden asked Congress for record peacetime spending on the military for the upcoming fiscal year.\\n\\nThe meeting comes amid questions about the future of NATO forces in Europe, including whether to install a permanent presence on the defense alliance's eastern border with Russia.\\nDuring a brief portion of the meeting open to reporters, Biden also expressed pride that women represented three of the senior officials included in the gathering. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "60  Ukraine proposed talks with Moscow over evacuating troops and civilians from Mariupol after a Russian surrender-or-die ultimatum expired on Wednesday, leaving many trapped at a steel plant, the last main stronghold of resistance. \\nA few dozen civilians managed to leave the strategically important southeastern port in a small bus convoy, according to Reuters witnesses, escaping the fiercest battle of the nearly eight-week-long war.\\nA Ukrainian marine commander, Serhiy Volny, said fighters there may not be able to hold out for much longer. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering at the steel works. \\nUkraine is ready for a \"special round of negotiations\" with no conditions \"to save our guys, (the far right) Azov (battalion), military, civilians, children, the living and the wounded,\" negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.\\nFighters remain holed up in the plant and have ignored an ultimatum by Russia to surrender. David Arakhamia, a second negotiator, said in an online post that he and Podolyak were in constant contact with Ukrainian forces in the city.\\n\"Today, in a conversation with the city defenders, a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison,\" he said. \"For our part, we are ready to arrive for such negotiations at any time as soon as we receive confirmation from the Russian side.\"\\nFewer civilians than hoped left on Wednesday, according to the authorities. \\nOver five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. Russia has yet to capture any major cities.\\nUkraine said it had so far held off an assault by thousands of Russian troops attempting to advance in what Kyiv calls the Battle of the Donbas, a new campaign to seize two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\\nRussia's forces had carried out strikes on dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine and had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near the village of Koroviy Yar, its defence ministry said. \\nOn Wednesday, Russia conducted a first test launch of its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new and long-awaited addition to its nuclear arsenal.\\n\"This truly unique weapon will ... provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country,\" President Vladimir Putin said. \\nRussia calls its incursion a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.\\nThe West has responded with a slew of sanctions.\\nThe United States on Wednesday imposed restrictions on dozens of people and entities, including a commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company, targeting the evasion of existing rules. \\nBILLOWING CLOUDS OF SMOKE\\nMariupol, once a prosperous city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets and Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said.\\nLarge black clouds of smoke billowed from there on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses, some clutching luggage or carrying small pets in their arms.\\nPensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia. She was leaving the city with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson.\\n\"It is a pleasure ... to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,\" she said tearfully. \\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave.\\nRussia did not immediately respond to the allegation.\\nIt denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the failure of earlier attempts to organise humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol.\\nThe deputy commander of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol, Svyatoslav Kalamar, said several bunkers under the plant still held about 80-100 civilians each.\\nJust five people in Mariupol had surrendered following Moscow's 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) surrender-or-die ultimatum, Russian-backed separatists said. \\nUkraine has proposed swapping Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for trapped civilians and soldiers. \\nIf Russia captured Mariupol it would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.\\nMoscow was forced to retreat from northern Ukraine after an assault on Kyiv was repelled last month, but has poured troops back in for an assault on the east that began this week.\\nPutin says Ukraine mistreated Russian speakers in the Donbas, an accusation Kyiv dismisses as false.\\nRussia was focusing on advancing towards the strategically important Donbas city of Sloviansk, but \"so far they are not succeeding\", Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said. \\nPEACE TALKS ELUSIVE\\nMeanwhile, peace negotiations have stalled. \\nThe Kremlin accused Kyiv on Wednesday of delaying the talks and changing its positions. Kyiv accuses Moscow of blocking talks by refusing humanitarian ceasefires.\\nThe head of Ukraine's Orthodox Church asked clergy and the faithful to forgo services on Easter Saturday night in areas affected by fighting, fearing the Russian bombardments will continue without respite.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden was convening top U.S. military leaders on Wednesday in an annual White House gathering that takes on special significance as the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and Washington plans more military aid.\\nCharles Michel, head of the European Council that groups the 27 EU member states, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv in a show of solidarity. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "

Manley told Reuters that demand for used and new vehicles remains strong.\\n\"We haven't seen any drop-off in our inquiry levels,\" Manley said. \"They are up year over year. The industry is at a level where there is more demand\" than supply of vehicles.\\nManley told analysts that while the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales has been running at recession levels, that is a reflection of the hits to production from supply chain snarls.\\n\"We have customers for everything that’s coming,\" Manley said. \\nAutoNation reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.78, beating estimates of $5.25 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Robust demand for used vehicles and sharply higher profit margins on new vehicle sales lifted profits. \\nAutoNation and Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD), two of the largest U.S. auto dealership chains with hundreds of stores each, both outperformed investor expectations in the January to March period. Online used car retailer Carvana, however, on Wednesday reported a wider loss than analysts had forecast and its shares fell before the market open.\\nLithia Chief Financial Officer Tina Miller also told Reuters \"demand has continued to outpace supply\" even as vehicle prices have risen, pushing average monthly payments to about $450 from the roughly $300 level before the pandemic.\\nLithia on Wednesday reported it doubled its first quarter net income compared to a year earlier as revenue rose by 54%. \\nAutoNation said its average gross profit on new vehicles it sold more than doubled in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, rising to $6,112.\\nAutoNation's sales of used vehicles rose by 47%, but average gross profit on used vehicles sales fell by 10%.\\nManley said the company became concerned about pricing and sales trends for certain used vehicles during the quarter, and moved to clear out inventory. \"We started to use the data we had available to us. We corrected very aggressively in the quarter,\" Manley said.\\nAutoNation, Lithia and other U.S. auto dealerships built on traditional showrooms are rapidly building the capability to sell and finance vehicles online, while expanding highly profitable repair operations that online dealers such as Carvana do not have. AutoNation reported 45.9% gross profit margins on parts and service during the first quarter. Revenue for service rose $1 billion, up 18% from last year.\\n\\nAutoNation's net income was $362.1 million, or $5.78 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, compared with $239.4 million, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier.\\nRevenue rose 14.4% to $6.75 billion, above estimates of $6.48 billion.\\n \\n</td>\n",

While demand has remained strong in the face of higher prices, affordability will always be an important factor to consider.\"\\nStill, many investors remain bullish on the company's prospects after Chief Executive Elon Musk hinted at the automaker being able to achieve 60% volume growth this year, up from 50% predicted in the fourth-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n\"I would be surprised if the margins came down because they just get better and better,\" said investor Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC, adding there will be some costs with investing in factories but production would also grow. \\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla has been posting record deliveries and earnings for several quarters while rivals have been battling global supply chain issues and even suspended production. \\n \\n</td>\n",

He receives no salary and his pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of escalating targets. \\nThe world's most valuable automaker said revenue was $18.8 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, versus estimates of $17.8 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This is up 81% from a year earlier.\\nRevenue from sales of its regulatory credits to other automakers jumped 31% to $679 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, helping boost revenue and profits. \\nIts earnings per share was $3.22, beatings analysts' estimates of $2.26. \\nTesla's pre-tax profit (EBITDA) per vehicle delivered rose by more than 60% to $16,203 in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier. \\nTesla said it has lost about a month of build volume out of its Shanghai factory due to COVID-related shutdowns. It said production is resuming at limited levels, which will impact total build and delivery volume in the second quarter.\\nMusk expected Tesla's total production in the current quarter to be similar to that of the first quarter. \\nGRAPHIC: Tesla earnings http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/TESLA-RESULTS/010010144FX/tesla.jpg \\nLITHIUM IS SOFTWARE \\nMusk said lithium is responsible for cost increases and \"a limiting factor\" to EV growth. \\nHe encouraged companies to get into the lithium business, which he said would generate high margins thanks to high prices.\\n\"The lithium margins right now are practically software margins....Do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.\"\\nHe also said Tesla will have \"some exciting announcements in the months to come\" regarding securing raw materials for batteries.\\nMusk said its own 4680 battery cells would become a risk to production next year if it does not solve volume production by early 2023. \"But we're highly confident of doing so.\" He also said as a risk mitigation, it will also use its existing, 2170 batteries for vehicles being made in Texas. \\nMusk said Tesla expects to mass produce a robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedal by 2024.\\nDuring the call, Musk did not mention Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which he offered to buy last week for $43 billion. Investors are concerned that he may sell some Tesla stocks or borrow against additional Tesla shares to finance his bid.\\nInvestors also worry about Musk being distracted by his Twitter bid at a time when Tesla is ramping up production at new factories in Berlin and Texas. \\n\\n\"Factory ramps take time, and Gigafactory Austin and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will be no different,\" Tesla said in a statement.\\nThe new factories will be key to meeting demand and reducing reliance on its China factory, its biggest one, which is recovering from a plant shutdown. \\n \\n</td>\n",

The EV company reported revenue of $18.76 billion, up 81% YoY, and above the consensus of $17.92 billion.\\nTesla’s free cash flow (FCF) in the quarter totaled $2.23 billion, compared to $293 million last year and a consensus projection of $671.8 million.\\nMore importantly, the automotive gross margin stood at 32.9%, compared to 26.5% in the year-ago quarter, and higher than the analyst consensus of 28.4%. The company reported a gross margin of 29.1%, also above the expected 25.8%.\\nForward-looking Commentary\\nTesla said it plans to start expanding its manufacturing capacity immediately.

Also, the industrialization of Tesla Cybertruck is seeing progress, the company said.\\nMusk's Compensation\\nWith the latest earnings report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reached three important performance goals worth a total of $23 billion in compensation.\\nThe carmaker’s strong revenue and EBITDA in the first quarter, along with robust reports from the previous three quarters, sees the company reach milestones that activate the vesting of 9th through 11th of 12 tranches of options awarded to Musk in his 2018 pay package.\\nEach tranche grants Musk the option to purchase 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 apiece, marking a discount of as much as 90% from the stock’s closing price of $977.20 on Wednesday.\\nAs a result, the three options that will vest following Tesla’s strong performance in the March quarter would provide Musk with compensation of roughly $23 billion.\\nThe new compensation comes just a few days after Musk made a $43 billion bid to acquire Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with some analysts predicting that the billionaire could borrow billions against Tesla shares.\\nAnalysts Reflect on Tesla's Q1 Performance\\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterated a Buy rating and a $1,200 price target on Tesla as the earnings report illustrated the benefits of Tesla's model and price-cost leadership, he told clients in a note.\\n“While we expect input costs to rise this year (and in addition we estimate that the Giga Shanghai shutdown could represent a 50-100bps headwind to non-GAAP auto gross margin in 2Q), we think Tesla can largely offset this driven not only by higher pricing flowing through backlog but also due to improvements including with casting, internally developed 4680 cells, and ramping up the Austin and Berlin factories,” Delaney said.\\nBank of America analyst John Murphy maintained his Neutral rating and a $1,300.00 per share price target after a “solid” performance.\\n“We have trepidation that TSLA stock may already be priced for perfection (or at least priced for hyperbolic growth), such that near-term earnings beats may be insufficient to get bulls incrementally positive on the stock. With this in mind, we reiterate our Neutral rating,” Murphy wrote to clients.\\nFinally, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli raised the price target on Tesla to $375.00 per share from $313.00 following an “impressive Q1.” The analyst is constructive on Tesla’s market-leading EV position but more skeptical of the company’s AV/FSD “architecture approach.”\\n“We think the current valuation remains challenging considering that the handful of other companies that previously achieved Tesla’s current market cap did so generating ~$100bln of gross profit (on avg.) vs. Tesla’s having just annualized ~$22bln in Q1 and as compared with our 2023E of ~$41bln. And while there’s little doubt that EV supply/demand broadly remains tight with EVs likely having also expanded the auto market, we need to be mindful that Tesla is adding sizable Model Y capacity in what are now price-points (&gt;$60k U.S.) where the market-size is inherently smaller and where EV supply/demand might not prove as tight with other new entries ramping,” Michaeli said in a memo to clients.\\nTesla stock price closed at $977.20 yesterday.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic</td>\n",

       "124  By Joseph White\\n(Reuters) -AutoNation Inc and other brick-and-mortar auto dealerships in the United States turned shortages of new and used vehicles to profitable advantage in the first quarter, but the No. 1 U.S. auto retailer's shares were volatile Thursday as analysts questioned the outlook for consumer demand.\\nDuring a conference call Thursday, analysts pressed AutoNation (NYSE:AN) Chief Executive Mike Manley on whether consumer demand for new vehicles is slowing, and why AutoNation's used car profit margins declined during the first quarter.\\nAutoNation shares were flat in early trading, after initially rising by 4.6% to $110.70 in premarket trading, then falling by nearly 5%. \\nRising interest rates, high gas prices and broader inflation in the U.S. economy are putting pressure on consumers. Manley told Reuters that demand for used and new vehicles remains strong.\\n\"We haven't seen any drop-off in our inquiry levels,\" Manley said. \"They are up year over year. The industry is at a level where there is more demand\" than supply of vehicles.\\nManley told analysts that while the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales has been running at recession levels, that is a reflection of the hits to production from supply chain snarls.\\n\"We have customers for everything that’s coming,\" Manley said. \\nAutoNation reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.78, beating estimates of $5.25 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Robust demand for used vehicles and sharply higher profit margins on new vehicle sales lifted profits. \\nAutoNation and Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD), two of the largest U.S. auto dealership chains with hundreds of stores each, both outperformed investor expectations in the January to March period. Online used car retailer Carvana, however, on Wednesday reported a wider loss than analysts had forecast and its shares fell before the market open.\\nLithia Chief Financial Officer Tina Miller also told Reuters \"demand has continued to outpace supply\" even as vehicle prices have risen, pushing average monthly payments to about $450 from the roughly $300 level before the pandemic.\\nLithia on Wednesday reported it doubled its first quarter net income compared to a year earlier as revenue rose by 54%. \\nAutoNation said its average gross profit on new vehicles it sold more than doubled in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, rising to $6,112.\\nAutoNation's sales of used vehicles rose by 47%, but average gross profit on used vehicles sales fell by 10%.\\nManley said the company became concerned about pricing and sales trends for certain used vehicles during the quarter, and moved to clear out inventory. \"We started to use the data we had available to us.

       "129  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's eye-popping profit margin has raised doubts among Wall Street analysts if the company would be able to keep at it amid rising commodity costs and higher expenses to increase production. \\nThe world's most valuable automaker pocketed a hefty 32.9% margin, more than double that of legacy firms including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis, who too have been spending heavily for a share of the lucrative electric vehicle market.\\nTesla's record margin that came on the back of higher prices is powering a nearly 9% rise in Tesla's stock price on Thursday and has led at least five analysts to raise their price target, but with a warning.\\nMargin could come under pressure in the coming months as the spending on rampup at the plants in Berlin and Texas gradually becomes a part of cost of production and moves out of research and development expenses, they said. \\n\"While the margins are impressive, some fear that they might be at their peak,\" said Julie Gillespie, head of market research at TipRanks.\\nRising commodity costs too could eat into margins even though Tesla's price increases are designed to offset higher anticipated costs in the next six to 12 months.\\nThe recent price hikes are for orders that are likely to be delivered a year later in some cases and could incur higher production costs, potentially squeezing the margins. \\nFor Tesla, this implies production rampup would play a crucial role. \"Its margins ultimately depend on how many cars rattle through the production line,\" Laura Hoy, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said. \\n\"That makes volume loss one of the biggest fundamental risks to the group's margins. While demand has remained strong in the face of higher prices, affordability will always be an important factor to consider.\"\\nStill, many investors remain bullish on the company's prospects after Chief Executive Elon Musk hinted at the automaker being able to achieve 60% volume growth this year, up from 50% predicted in the fourth-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n\"I would be surprised if the margins came down because they just get better and better,\" said investor Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC, adding there will be some costs with investing in factories but production would also grow. \\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla has been posting record deliveries and earnings for several quarters while rivals have been battling global supply chain issues and even suspended production. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

The company still expects vehicle deliveries to grow by 50% annually, though it warned that supply chain challenges will likely remain throughout the rest of the year.\\nThe carmaker says its Texas gigafactory will produce Model Y vehicles using both structural packs with 4680 cells and non-structural packs with 2170 cells later this year. Also, the industrialization of Tesla Cybertruck is seeing progress, the company said.\\nMusk's Compensation\\nWith the latest earnings report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reached three important performance goals worth a total of $23 billion in compensation.\\nThe carmaker’s strong revenue and EBITDA in the first quarter, along with robust reports from the previous three quarters, sees the company reach milestones that activate the vesting of 9th through 11th of 12 tranches of options awarded to Musk in his 2018 pay package.\\nEach tranche grants Musk the option to purchase 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 apiece, marking a discount of as much as 90% from the stock’s closing price of $977.20 on Wednesday.\\nAs a result, the three options that will vest following Tesla’s strong performance in the March quarter would provide Musk with compensation of roughly $23 billion.\\nThe new compensation comes just a few days after Musk made a $43 billion bid to acquire Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with some analysts predicting that the billionaire could borrow billions against Tesla shares.\\nAnalysts Reflect on Tesla's Q1 Performance\\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterated a Buy rating and a $1,200 price target on Tesla as the earnings report illustrated the benefits of Tesla's model and price-cost leadership, he told clients in a note.\\n“While we expect input costs to rise this year (and in addition we estimate that the Giga Shanghai shutdown could represent a 50-100bps headwind to non-GAAP auto gross margin in 2Q), we think Tesla can largely offset this driven not only by higher pricing flowing through backlog but also due to improvements including with casting, internally developed 4680 cells, and ramping up the Austin and Berlin factories,” Delaney said.\\nBank of America analyst John Murphy maintained his Neutral rating and a $1,300.00 per share price target after a “solid” performance.\\n“We have trepidation that TSLA stock may already be priced for perfection (or at least priced for hyperbolic growth), such that near-term earnings beats may be insufficient to get bulls incrementally positive on the stock. With this in mind, we reiterate our Neutral rating,” Murphy wrote to clients.\\nFinally, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli raised the price target on Tesla to $375.00 per share from $313.00 following an “impressive Q1.” The analyst is constructive on Tesla’s market-leading EV position but more skeptical of the company’s AV/FSD “architecture approach.”\\n“We think the current valuation remains challenging considering that the handful of other companies that previously achieved Tesla’s current market cap did so generating ~$100bln of gross profit (on avg.) vs. Tesla’s having just annualized ~$22bln in Q1 and as compared with our 2023E of ~$41bln. And while there’s little doubt that EV supply/demand broadly remains tight with EVs likely having also expanded the auto market, we need to be mindful that Tesla is adding sizable Model Y capacity in what are now price-points (>$60k U.S.) where the market-size is inherently smaller and where EV supply/demand might not prove as tight with other new entries ramping,” Michaeli said in a memo to clients.\\nTesla stock price closed at $977.20 yesterday.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic                                                                 \n",
       "184  By Jonathan Stempel\\n(Reuters) -Elon Musk will not be subjected to a \"gag order\" preventing him from discussing a lawsuit claiming he defrauded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shareholders by tweeting in 2018 about taking his electric car company private, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.\\nU.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco agreed with Musk and Tesla that the proposed temporary restraining order appeared overbroad because it prevented Musk from speaking to \"anyone\" about the case.\\nChen also found no proof that letting Musk, the world's richest person according to Forbes, talk publicly posed a \"clear and present danger\" or \"serious and imminent threat\" to a trial.\\nBut the judge also said he plans to tell jurors at the scheduled January 2023 trial he had already ruled that Musk's tweets were false, and made with sufficient knowledge they were false.\\nShareholders sued over losses resulting from volatility in Tesla's shares after Musk tweeted on Aug. 7, 2018, that he had \"funding secured\" to potentially take Tesla private at $420 per share, and that \"investor support is confirmed.\"\\nNicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the shareholders, in an email said he was pleased that jurors will be instructed that the tweets \"were false and were made fraudulently by Elon Musk.\" He said the primary remaining issue is the amount of damages owed.\\nLawyers for Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nThe April 15 request for a gag order came one day after Musk told the TED conference in Vancouver that he had lined up funding to privatize Tesla, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud anyway over his tweeting.\\nMusk and Tesla said the proposed gag order \"evokes a level of censorship\" that could not be reconciled with the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of free speech.\\nThey also said an order could block Musk from communicating with Tesla shareholders, discussing his proposal to buy  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), and trying to end his consent decree with the SEC, which requires Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets.\\n\\nMusk has said he would never lie to shareholders.

At the stock's current price, the three options tranches that will vest as a result of Tesla's March-quarter performance could generate a profit of about $23 billion, or almost $7.7 billion per tranche.\\nLate last year, Musk netted $16.4 billion from selling about 10% of his stake in Tesla to meet to meet tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "

       "      <td>(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. West Coast is importing gasoline at a near-record pace this month to help ease supply constraints amid eye-popping pump prices just ahead of the peak summer driving season.\\nAround 120,000 barrels a day of gasoline and blending components are expected to reach the U.S. West Coast in April, including 95,000 barrels a day that have already arrived, marking the second-highest monthly level since oil analytics firm Vortexa began tracking the data in January 2016. The region imported 150,000 barrels a day in May 2019.\\nThese imports underscore the need to replenish supply ahead of what’s shaping up to be a tight summer for gasoline. A heavy maintenance season that’s just now winding down left West Coast refinery rates at 84% last week. That has put additional pressure on drivers, with Californians paying more than anywhere else in the U.S. for gasoline.\\n Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) is due to carry out major maintenance in June at its Richmond, California refinery, one of the West Coast’s largest, after a labor strike delayed the original schedule in April. This will tighten gasoline supplies during peak demand months. Meanwhile, signs that high fuel prices may have deterred some drivers in March have now evaporated with implied U.S. gasoline demand reverting to the seasonal rising norm, pushing inventories below the five-year average for this time of year nationally and on the West Coast.\\nThe jump in imports is driven by increased volumes from Asia, which accounted for about 60% of the monthly volume. Indian refineries have been operating at above 100% capacity in order to capture high export margins, while China is ramping up fuel exports as a Covid-19 resurgence weighs on local demand.\\nPump prices in California are still hovering near record levels, while the rest of the country saw a reprieve earlier this month. Californians are now paying an average of $5.689 a gallon for gasoline, 4% lower than the peak of $5.919 a gallon reached on March 29, according to auto club AAA. Meanwhile, national pump prices are heading higher once again at $4.12 a gallon.\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\\n</td>\n",

Ukraine is the world's fifth biggest corn producer, with farmers harvesting 41.9 million tonnes in 2021.\\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department said that 4% of the U.S. corn crop had been seeded as of April 17, down 3 percentage points from a year earlier and below the five-year average of 6%. Farmers in major production states such as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and North Dakota had not seeded any corn yet. [US/COR]\\n\"This has been a spring that's had trouble getting started,\" said David Streit, a Commodity Weather Group meteorologist.\\n\\nMore rain was in the forecast this weekend for southern areas of the Midwest where farmers are typically running planters by now. And then cold temperatures return next week following a brief warm-up, Streit added.\\nU.S. farmers aim to have their corn seeding finished by the middle of May as yield potential can be reduced by about a bushel per acre for each day their crop is planted past that deadline. \\n \\n</td>\n",

Any easing by the U.S. Treasury Department of a restricted license the four companies share with  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) could let them expand operations.\\nSince the United States first imposed oil trading sanctions on Venezuela, many firms removed equipment and staff and wrote off hundreds of millions dollars of their assets there. But over a dozen rigs remain stored near the nation's largest oilfields.\\nA high-level meeting last month between U.S. and Venezuelan officials opened the door to a possible return of Venezuela's oil to the United States. Sanctions were first imposed in 2019 to choke oil exports and deprive Caracas of its main source of revenue in its bid to see the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \\nThe talks coincided with Washington's ban on Russian oil imports, a measure that will take full effect this week, potentially hurting U.S. refiners and contributing to rising fuel prices. \\nOil companies that still have a presence in Venezuela could promptly reactivate equipment in the country, the sources said, potentially reviving crude output, which remains at 40% of pre-sanction levels.\\n\"If PDVSA's joint ventures are seeking to obtain licenses to operate, they will need the oil services companies,\" Reinaldo Quintero, president of Venezuela's Petroleum Chamber told Reuters. \\nSeveral U.S.-based and local oilfield firms have approached the chamber to express their desire to resume work in Venezuela, he added, declining to provide details on the talks.\\nBaker Hughes said it would not comment on speculation or future activity. Schlumberger said its policies do not permit lobbying or political contributions. Halliburton declined to comment on future plans in Venezuela. \\nInvestment firm Amos Global Energy has submitted requests to the United States to participate in Venezuela's energy sector and has an oilfield company ready to provide services if granted, founder Ali Moshiri said.\\nWeatherford and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment.\\nLINING UP \\nChevron has requested authorization from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to take operating control of its projects with PDVSA. The oil major also has begun readying a team for returning Venezuelan crude to the United States.\\nBut U.S officials are still debating whether to revamp the current license, set to expire in June, sources in Washington familiar with the talks said. The move would be widely seen as an easing of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. \\nProspects for a change dimmed after an outcry from Republican lawmakers and some of Biden's fellow Democrats following the Caracas talks. U.S. officials are mindful that there could be further blowback if it proceeds, the people added. \\nSome U.S. oilfield firms have communicated individually to the U.S. Treasury through intermediaries support for Chevron's efforts to get an expanded license and could provide services if an approval is granted, one of the Washington sources said.\\nThe talks were not made through formal lobbying, according to two company sources. \\nEven though the companies' current petition is for resuming some operations using mothballed drilling units in Venezuela, they hope to later secure U.S. permits to bring in additional equipment, the person added. \\nThe U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. \\nLETHARGIC OUTPUT \\nSmall firms hired by PDVSA since 2021 to revive oil output mainly by coil tubing techniques and well maintenance have helped stop a free-fall in production and exports.\\nBut Venezuela's active drilling rig count remains at zero since 2020, versus 87 units in 2013, according to Baker Hughes' statistics. A portion of equipment once operated by local contractors and Russia-controlled firms is now inactive.\\nOnly a handful of big drilling rigs are deployed in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela's main oil region, and the ones there</td>\n",

A gradual phasing out would give time for trade flows to adjust in a more orderly fashion and so the impact on price would be more limited compared to an immediate ban,” added ING.\\nElsewhere, Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stated on Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.\\nTurning to the demand side, investors continue to monitor the COVID outbreak and associated lockdowns in China, the world’s largest import of crude, as the country struggles to contain a surge in cases including the first fatalities since the original outbreak.\\nCrude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed a draw of 8 million barrels last week, suggesting demand remains strong in the world’s largest consumer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) -San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Thursday said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets.\\nDaly's support for a path of policy tightening that would bring borrowing costs to the Fed's estimate of the neutral level in nine months has helped cement expectations in recent weeks for interest rate hikes in bigger-than-usual 50 basis-point increments at the Fed's next couple of policy meetings. \\n\"Is it 50, is it 25, is it 75? Those are things that I'll deliberate with my colleagues, but my own starting point is we don't want to go so quickly or so abruptly that we surprise Americans\" already dealing with 40-year-high inflation, Daly told Yahoo Finance. \\n\\n\"I'm watching over this year to see how much our move to neutral restrains the economy, along with the repair of supply chains and the fiscal rolloff,\" all of which should contribute to easing inflation, she said.\\nWhether rates will then need to rise beyond neutral where they would begin to actually restrict economic growth, Daly said, \"is an open question and one I don't want to get prematurely to before we see the data.\"\\n \\n</td>\n",

Sotomayor pointed out that as the island does not have voting representation in Congress, its people cannot rely on Congress to recognize their rights.\\n\"Equal treatment of citizens should not be left to the vagaries of the political process,\" Sotomayor wrote.\\nA provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is part of Democratic-backed social spending legislation that has stalled in Congress. \\n'A DEVASTATING DAY'\\nJose Luis Vaello Madero, the disabled 67-year-old man at the center of the case, received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The U.S. government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico.\\n\"It is unfortunate the court failed to see the discrimination faced by the most needy Puerto Rican Americans whose only distinguishing feature is that they choose to remain in Puerto Rico, their home on U.S. soil. This is a devastating day for Mr. Vaello Madero and for Puerto Rico,\" said Hermann Ferre, Vaello Madero's lawyer. \\nThe Justice Department declined comment.\\nMany Puerto Ricans have long complained that the island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the most-populous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people.\\nSSI benefits are available to American citizens living in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.\\nThe Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. Those rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. \\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch in a separate opinion said the court in a future case should overturn the Insular Cases, saying they \"rest on racial stereotypes\" and \"deserve no place in our law.\"\\n\\nCongress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the SSI program. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different benefits program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. \\nThe government's appeal originally was filed by former President Donald Trump's administration. Biden's administration continued the appeal while also urging Congress to extend SSI to Puerto Rico. \\n \\n</td>\n",

An acute shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low, helping to fuel inflation, and forcing the Federal Reserve to adopt a restrictive monetary policy stance.\\nThe U.S. central bank faces a tricky balancing act of slowing demand without plunging the economy into recession. So far, households continue to spend and businesses are hungry for workers to meet consumer demand. \\nBut trouble could be brewing, with other data on Thursday showing a measure of future business activity in the mid-Atlantic region tumbling in April to a level last seen 14 years ago, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession.\\n\"Economic growth may eventually hit a wall without more workers for companies to hire, but not today,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. \"Jobless claims at near-record lows mean worker wages will continue to go up and up, guaranteeing that inflation remains more persistent and at more worrisome levels for longer than Fed officials believe.\" \\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 184,000 for the week ended April 16. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 180,000 applications for the latest week. Claims plunged to a more than 53-year low of 166,000 during the week ending March 19. \\nThere is probably limited scope for further declines.\\nLast week, applications tumbled by 7,656 in Missouri. There were also substantial declines in Ohio, Texas, New York and Michigan, which offset increases in Connecticut and California. \\nThe Fed in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first rate hike in more than three years. Economists expect a half-percentage-point rate increase next month, and for the U.S. central bank to soon start trimming its asset holdings.\\nClaims, which have dropped from a record high of 6.137 million in early April 2020, will be closely watched for signs of whether rising borrowing costs are curbing demand. \\nStocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\\nWORKER SHORTAGE\\nDemand for labor is holding strong for now. The Fed's Beige Book, based on information collected on or before April 11 from the central bank's business contacts, showed on Wednesday that \"demand for workers continued to be strong across most districts and industry sectors,\" but noted \"hiring was held back by the overall lack of available workers.\"\\nThere were a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February. The unemployment rate is at 3.6%, just one-tenth of a percentage point above its pre-pandemic level.\\nBut there are signs labor supply will soon improve. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 58,000 to 1.417 million during the week ending April 9. The was the lowest level for the so-called continuing claims since February 1970.\\nThe demand-supply imbalance is stoking wage inflation. A second report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed 80% of firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported wages and compensation costs had increased over the past three months.\\nA majority of firms in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, said they had adjusted their 2022 budgets for wages and compensation since the beginning of the year, with 65% reporting they were planning to increase wages and compensation by \"more than originally planned,\" and a third intending \"to increase wages and compensation sooner than originally planned.\" \\nThe Philadelphia Fed's business activity index dropped to 17.6 this month from 27.4 in March. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector. \\nManufacturers' assessment of business activity over the next six months was downbeat, with the index dropping 15 points to 8.2, the lowest reading since December 2008. \\nStill, firms hired more workers, with the survey's gauge of factory employment reaching an all-time high. Companies planned to retain their workforces over the next six months.\\nLast week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the March and April payrolls survey periods. \\n\\nEconomists are expecting strong employment growth in April. Payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in March, marking the 11th straight month of employment gains in excess of 400,000.\\n\"The labor market remains in excellent shape as the spring quarter begins,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \\n \\n</td>\n",

Companies that do not meet the deadlines could see their platforms banned in the country, they added.\\nSocial media companies have also been told content that harms national security must be taken down immediately, according to two of the people and a third source. \\nCurrently, social media platforms often have a few days to handle requests from the Vietnamese government, the sources said.\\nThe amendments, which have not been made public, are expected to be signed by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh next month and enforced from July, five people said.\\nSources who spoke with Reuters for this article declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.\\nVietnam's foreign ministry said amendments to law concerning online information are being reviewed by the government.\\n\"Vietnam demands that businesses actively coordinate with the government in building a safe and healthy online environment, removing contents that are inappropriate or against legal regulations and national traditions of Vietnam,\" it said in an emailed statement.\\nRepresentatives for Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which owns YouTube and Google, declined to comment.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it had no immediate comment. \\nTikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will continue to comply with applicable local laws to ensure TikTok remains a safe space for creative expression, its Vietnam representative Nguyen Lam Thanh told Reuters, adding it would take down content that breaks platform guidelines.\\nMost governments do not have laws imposing the taking down of content on social media firms, but Vietnam's move comes amid intensifying crackdowns in some parts of the world on online content that have alarmed activists.\\nIndonesia's government is also preparing to impose a similar 24-hour time frame for government requests, sources have told Reuters.\\nIndia requires government requests to be met within 36 hours.\\nA MAJOR MARKET\\nVietnam, with a population of 98 million, is among Facebook's top 10 markets by user numbers with 60-70 million people on the platform, according to 2021 company data. \\nThe country generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for Facebook and is more profitable than many European markets, according to sources familiar with the matter.\\nYouTube has 60 million users in Vietnam and TikTok has 20 million, according to 2021 government estimates. Twitter is not as popular as most Vietnamese see it as an English forum.\\nBut the market poses ethical quandaries. Vietnam's Communist Party tolerates little criticism and the country's courts have handed out lengthy jail terms to dissidents and activists for posts critical of the government on Facebook and YouTube. \\nGovernment efforts to exert control over online content have only intensified. A cybersecurity law introduced in 2019 was followed up by national guidelines on social media behaviour in June last year. \\nIn 2020, Facebook agreed to significantly increase the censorship of \"anti-state\" posts for local users after Vietnamese authorities slowed traffic to its platform and threatened to shut it down entirely, company sources have previously told Reuters.\\nFacebook said at the time it had reluctantly complied with the government's request to \"restrict access to content which it has deemed to be illegal\".\\nHARD TO IMPLEMENT\\nThe planned changes stem from the government's dissatisfaction with current take-down rates for its requests, the sources said.\\nAccording to data from Vietnam's communications ministry, during the first quarter of 2022, Facebook complied with 90% of the government's take-down requests, Alphabet complied with 93% and TikTok complied with 73%.\\nThe sources said in addition to removing \"illegal\" content, the government wants social media firms to change algorithms to limit content concerning sexually suggestive material, gambling and the sale of unregulated medicines and supplements.\\nThe government is also keen to take down accounts of celebrities it believes are using their influence to sell unsuitable products, defame others and promote false charitable causes, they said.\\n\\nSocial media firms will have difficulty complying with take-down requests in 24 hours, the sources added.\\nThey noted that while obvious infractions of their own company rules like depictions of extreme violence can be handled very quickly, other requests take longer to assess and finding qualified staff is a challenge.\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- The euro surges as officials put a July rate hike back on the agenda. Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde both speak on the sidelines of the IMF meeting later. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) beats earnings expectations, but raises a few eyebrows in the process. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) forecasts good times ahead, but Equifax (NYSE:EFX) is downbeat about the outlook for the mortgage credit market. Russia declares 'victory' over a city where Ukrainian forces are still fighting, a day after it defaulted on a dollar bond payment due to the lack of cooperation from its U.S. bankers. AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) results, jobless claims and the Philly Fed business survey are due. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 21st April.\\n1. Tesla’s earnings blow past expectations, raise eyebrows\\nTesla reported another stronger-than-expected quarter in the three months through March, with a net profit of $3.32 billion. That included a $679 million contribution from regulatory emissions credits, but an operating profit of $3.6 billion indicated solid underlying momentum in its core business.\\nCEO Elon Musk said the group should be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year, despite challenges from a three-week shutdown at Shanghai that only ended earlier this week.\\nSome cast doubt on the group’s accounting, suggesting that Tesla either wasn’t recognizing steep input price inflation or faced a big jump in costs in coming quarters. The company reported a 15% increase in operating expenditure, but an 80% rise in revenue. The disparity may lie partially in the company using up raw material inventories that were bought before prices for inputs such as battery metals went through the roof earlier this year.\\nTesla stock rose over 7% in premarket trading, more than reversing Wednesday’s declines.\\n2. ECB officials put July rate hike in play\\nThe euro rose to its highest in over a week after Vice President Luis de Guindos joined a chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of a rate increase in July. That would be the bank’s first in 12 years, and represents a significant shift after President Christine Lagarde soft-pedaled the outlook for tightening policy at her press conference last week.\\nLagarde and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell both speak on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting later, an event that has gathered the world’s central bankers at a time when inflation is running amok globally.\\nBy 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the euro was at $1.0915, up 0.6% on the day and just off its intraday high.\\n3. Stocks set to open higher; United soars, Equifax slumps\\nU.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, with Tesla’s well-received earnings helping to calm the fears stoked by Netflix’s results on Tuesday. \\nBy 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 208 points, or 0.6%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.1%. The Nasdaq had underperformed sharply on Wednesday, due to the heavy weighting of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which suffered its biggest one-day drop in 18 years. Netflix stock fell another 1.2% in premarket trading.\\nStocks likely to be in focus later include United Airlines, which reported upbeat guidance after the bell on Wednesday despite showing another big quarterly loss, and Equifax, which fell nearly 10% in after-hours trading after forecasting a sharp slowdown in mortgage credit inquiries over the rest of the year.\\nAT&amp;T dominates the early reporters, along with Danaher (NYSE:DHR), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), while Swiss giant Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) already reported a thumping 7.6% rise in first-quarter sales, over 5% of which was due to price increases.\\n4. Jobless claims, Philly Fed survey due\\nThe number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits is expected to stay close to 60-year lows at 8:30 AM ET, a reflection of the continuing tightness of the U.S. labor market. Analysts expect initial claims to tick back down to 180,000 after last week’s increase to 185,000. Continuing claims are expected to grind lower to 1.455 million, a drop of 20,000.\\nThe numbers will be released at the same time as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s monthly manufacturing survey, which is expected to show a slight cooling of activity from February.\\nOf more interest than either may be the auction of inflation-protected 5-year Treasury notes at 1 PM ET. The last auction sold at an average yield of -1.508%. That’s unlikely to be repeated given the sharp rise in real bond yields in recent weeks.\\n5. Russia declares 'victory' in Mariupol\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin declared victory in the country’s battle for the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, even though elements of the defending forces continue to fight on. Putin told Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu in a choreographed video clip that Russian forces should rather conserve lives than storm the remaining Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steel mill.\\nPutin’s comments come a week after the loss of the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship Moskva. Moscow’s failure to account for a crew that it says was fully evacuated prior to the sinking has revived long-standing suspicions of the state’s disregard for its servicemen.\\nRussia was declared in potential default on Wednesday by an international committee overseeing credit derivatives. However, the failure to pay occurred because the western banks acting as payment agents refused to handle Russia’s dollars, rather than because Russia had chosen not to pay. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Russia's oil output fell to its lowest this year last week amid increasing practical problems in getting its product to willing buyers.</td>\n",

Now joining him are policymakers like San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans who had been among the most persistent in arguing inflation could ease with less action by the Fed. \\n\"I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path,\" Daly said on Wednesday, referring to the interest rate level that officials see as neither fanning nor restricting the economy, a key but often difficult-to-estimate touchstone for policymaking.\\nThat remark placed her, like Evans, in support of raising the federal funds rate by half a percentage point at coming meetings rather than just a quarter point, a step that until recently was the province of more hard-core Fed inflation fighters.\\nIf officials follow through, they will have moved the federal funds rate from near zero to neutral in nine months after a first hike in March. Other tightening cycles have involved larger absolute increases in rates but came when estimates of neutral were higher, so policy remained \"accommodative\" for longer.\\nIn the cycle starting in mid-2004, for example, it took about two years to reach what a New York Fed model estimates the neutral rate was then, around 5.25%. It took a year, beginning in late 1993, to reach neutral during a cycle often cited as a possible parallel to this one by bringing inflation down without a recession.\\nA 'VOLCKER MOMENT'\\nOfficials hope that some of the current inflation fades on its own, letting them bring it back towards their 2% target without highly restrictive rates that would increase the risk of recession.\\nGiven the complexities of the moment, from the Ukraine war to the pandemic's continued impacts on global supply chains, achieving that is tough</td>\n",

Spending has been hit hard by lockdowns across the country that began last month to contain the spread of COVID-19.\\nFinal consumption accounted for 69.4% of China's GDP growth in the first quarter, according to official data.\\n \\n</td>\n",

It's a little bit of a mixed bag,\" he said in the interview.\\nWith inflationary pressure still muted, there was no need for the BOJ to change its ultra-loose policy, Panth said.\\n\\nWhile temporary factors, such as the dissipating effect of past cuts in cellphone fees, could push up headline consumer price inflation, Japan was unlikely to see inflation sustainably reach the BOJ's 2% target in the near term, he added.\\n\"Japan is in a very different situation compared with other advanced countries who have begun tightening monetary policy,\" he said. \"We do not see any need to change the accommodative monetary policy stance.\"\\n \\n</td>\n",

It had hit a 20-month low of $1.0757 after Lagarde's press conference on Thursday.\\nNewswires quoted De Guindos as saying that there was \"no reason\" why the bank can't end its net asset purchases in July, which would pave the way for an interest rate hike almost immediately after. However, he stressed that any raising of rates would be \"data-dependent,\" given that the risks to the economic outlook have increased considerably with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week, the IMF had downgraded its growth forecast for the Eurozone this year to 2.8% from an earlier estimate of 3.9%. Inflation, meanwhile, is running at an all-time high for the single currency at 7.5%, although De Guindos said he expects it to moderate by the year-end.\\nOvernight, Belgian National Bank Governor Wunsch had told Bloomberg in an interview that a sequence of rate hikes this year was likely.\\n\"Without any really bad news coming from that front, hiking by the end of this year to zero or slightly positive territory for me would be a no brainer,” Wunsch said.\\nOn Wednesday, meanwhile, Bundesbank head Nagel had said “It seems we’ll be able to end net purchases, possibly already at the end of the second quarter,” paving the way for a first rate increase “at the beginning of the third quarter.\"</td>\n",

After a few years of expanding Saint Laurent's store network, the group is shifting investments to other areas like communication and marketing, as well as expanding its product range. \\n“The fundamentals of the luxury market in China remain intact,” Kering Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists in a call, noting the resilience of Chinese consumers after crisis periods, the growing middle class and appetite in the country for luxury brands, echoing comments from other luxury groups including LVMH and Hermes, which both recently reported a strong start to the year.\\nThe executive cautioned, however, that the lockdowns were tougher than the intermittent disruptions last summer, and noted an impact on consumer sentiment in the country.\\nKering has been expanding Gucci's product range with an emphasis on the higher end and executives flagged good traction at higher price points.\\nStore closures in China, in March and April, however, adversely affected lower price points and slowed the label's ability to draw in new, younger clients, they said in a call with analysts. \\nCFO Duplaix said it was a bit early to comment on expectations for earnings at Gucci, noting \"a lot of moving parts,\" citing the lockdowns in China, where currently nearly a third of the group's store network is in cities affected by restrictions, and the war in Ukraine. \\n\\nHe also said it was too early to measure the impact of inflation on luxury demand and costs, noting there was room for price increases at some labels including Gucci, which raised some prices toward the end of the quarter in the low and mid-single-digit percentages.\\n($1 = 0.9232 euro)\\n \\n</td>\n",

He has avoided clashing with protesters despite a series of blockades that have hit the country's main export sector.\\n\"The problem has to be solved now,\" Peru's Prime Minister Anibal Torres said on Wednesday, citing \"irrational\" community demands at Cuajone, including asking for $5 billion in payments. \"That has led us to declare a state of emergency.\"\\nMeanwhile, last week residents of the indigenous Fuerabamba community pitched tents just feet away from Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's huge Las Bambas open pit copper deposit.\\nThe protests have taken a combined 20% of Peru's copper production offline at a time when the Andean country is battling slower growth amid high global inflation.\\n\"Under this administration there are a greater number of mining protests and they are more serious,\" said Pablo O'Brien, a mining expert who worked as an adviser to several mining ministers, including under Castillo. \\n\"The protests last longer than they ever did and they have spread to regions where you didn't see social conflicts before.\"\\n'WE COULD STAY FOR YEARS'\\nProtests have also hit other mines in Peru since Castillo came to office last July, including the Anglo-Swiss Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s Antapaccay, and Canada-based Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) Inc's Constancia and Antamina mines, co-owned by Glencore and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP.\\nIn neighboring Chile, the No. 1 global copper producer, BHP is also facing road blockades that have disrupted operations at its major Escondida mine, forcing it to cut its annual copper production outlook this week. \\nBut the pinch has been felt harder in Peru, where Cuajone and Las Bambas put together add up to 1.5% of the country's gross domestic product. Shares of Southern Copper and MMG have plummeted over 5 and 8% respectively in the past week. \\nLas Bambas executives have called on the government to also declare a state of emergency at the mine.\\n\"Las Bambas currently is coordinating with the government, and we hope they can take the same action for Las Bambas,\" Wei Jianxian, MMG's Executive General Manager for the Americas, said in a call with analysts this week.\\nA government press representative said they were not aware of any plans for a state of emergency for Las Bambas. \\nProtesters, however, say they are digging in for the long-run, indicating that disruptions to the mining sector won't be easy to dismantle and that industry will continue to pressure the government to take firmer action.\\n\"We could stay here for years,\" Edison Vargas, 32, the president of the Fuerabamba community, told Reuters. Vargas and others have set up camp inside Las Bambas and say they are demanding the return of their ancestral lands.\\nThe mine had resettled some 400 Fuerabamba families over a decade ago in a compact urban town dubbed Nueva Fuerabamba to make way for the construction of Las Bambas, one of the world's top copper mines. It paid residents 600 million soles ($161 million) as compensation for the move, mine executives say.\\n\\nLas Bambas is notorious for mining conflicts and has faced over 450 days of road blockades since the mine opened in 2016. \\n\"If the government wants to turn their backs on us, we are ready,\" Vargas added. \"We prefer to die here in our old lands than back in Nueva Fuerabamba.\" \\n \\n</td>\n",

That helped to boost its overall earnings beyond what analysts had expected.\\n\"This will likely have the effect of making ongoing quarterly fee-related earnings somewhat higher, but also somewhat more volatile,\" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.\\nBlackstone has been mindful of the prospect of rising inflation and higher interest rates for years, which has informed its decision to concentrate its investments in hard assets such as warehouses, rental housing, enterprise software, and digital and energy infrastructure, President Jonathan Gray said during an analyst earnings call on Thursday.\\n\"We've been mindful of the prospect of rising interest rates and a normalization of market multiples for several years.

If the plan moves forward, Plotkin would achieve this without having to bring Melvin investors back to even on their invested money before he could make a performance profit.\\nThis is because it would be extremely difficult for Plotkin to bring investors back even after the fund sustained a 39% loss in 2021 and an additional 21% loss this year.\\nPlotkin plans to keep the new fund at or below $5 billion in capital and focus on shorting stocks once again, a strategy that yielded him substantial returns over the past years before taking a heavy blow amid the meme stock craze in January 2021.\\nThe move would give Plotkin and Melvin Capital a second chance after a year and a half of disappointing performance, as well as enable him to retain his employees who were likely to leave due to lack of performance fees.\\nThe impact of the new plan remains unclear as well as how much capital would Melvin investors reinvest in the new fund.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic</td>\n",

They ... appreciate that the plan is ambitious, credible and realistic,\" Donnet said after meeting shareholders in London, New York and Boston. \\nHaving successfully steered Generali through the pandemic during his six years at the helm, Donnet said Generali would meet its financial goals despite the Ukraine war.\\n\"I'm very confident we'll hit the plan's targets despite the current geopolitical difficulties,\" he said.\\nAsked about Generali's Russian business, Donnet said the insurer was working to wind down, as announced, its Europ Assistance operations in the country, where its sole customer is Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), while it would keep its stake in local insurer Ingosstrakh frozen. \\n\"It's not a good time to sell, we don't want to enter negotiations with Russian counterparts.\"\\n'RATIONAL BEINGS'\\nDonnet said institutional investors, who hold roughly a third of Generali's capital, struggled to understand the reasons behind what they saw as an Italian \"soap opera\".\\n\"Investors are rational beings and they're very perplexed by what is happening,\" said Donnet, who holds dual Italian and French nationality. \"And I also have trouble explaining it because I'm also a rational being.\"\\nBlaming Donnet for what they see as an overly timid acquisition strategy, the rebel investors say Generali has fallen behind rival AXA and Allianz (ETR:ALVG) in terms of market value, though Italy's top insurer has generated the sector's highest total shareholder return since 2016.\\nGenerali has earmarked 3 billion euros for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), less than half the 7 billion euros indicated by the challengers. \\nDonnet said the M&amp;A budget was \"enough to clinch good transactions\", adding that while \"the pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities is never empty ... good deals mature slowly\".\\nHe pointed to the recently concluded acquisition of French healthcare professional insurer La Medicale, which had required six years of bilateral negotiations. \\n\\nGenerali would not shy away if \"the dream acquisition\" came along and would turn to investors to raise capital if it had to spend more than the allotted 3 billion euros.\\n\"We are well-placed to tap the market for cash.

       "      <td>Soaring demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as buyers steer clear of Russian fuel is putting some long-stalled U.S. export projects back on track. But rising costs for materials and labor threaten to snarl these plants once again.\\nTwo developers with projects sidelined due to the U.S.-China trade war –  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) with its Lake Charles LNG and Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc with its Driftwood LNG – have begun talks with construction provider Bechtel Group over costs, according to a spokesperson and regulatory filing. \\nMaterials prices have shot up 20% in the past two years while gas compressors are 30% costlier, construction and energy experts said. Metals required for LNG projects are in short supply due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and could add another 10% to costs, they added. \\nHigher costs mean lower returns and could give an edge to rivals with newer, modular designs that rely on off-the-shelf components and, in one case, speedier construction using oil platforms for production sites. Costs of U.S. natural gas hit a 13-year high this month, adding to financial hurdles.\\n\"Who knows what LNG terminals are going to cost now,\" warned Michael Smith, CEO of Freeport LNG, a Texas firm that started commercial production in 2019 after a four-year construction period. \\nA large portion of construction material costs are steel and nickel alloy piping, Smith said at last month's CERAWeek energy conference. \"Fifty percent of nickel comes from Russia.\" \\nSOARING MATERIALS COST\\nSteel used to assemble LNG storage tanks is up about 10% this year and nickel, required to make steel and nickel alloys for piping, has gained 40% since February, according to Black &amp; Veatch, which designs and builds LNG terminals. \\nRebar, steel used to strengthen concrete, cost more than $1,100 per short tonne on April 8, up 10% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and up 40% from a year earlier, S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Commodity Insights' Platts assessments show. [IRONORE/]\\nRising costs to build a new U.S. LNG export facility makes it \"more expensive for a developer to move forward,\" said Kenneth Medlock III, a fellow in Energy and Resource Economics at Baker Institute for Public Policy. \\nLNG plants built a few years ago cost about $540 per tonne of annual LNG output, putting the construction of a 10 million tonne per annum plant at $5.4 billion, said Greg Vesey, former CEO of LNG Ltd, which sold its proposed export project in 2020. \\n\"At a 25% increase, the range is going to be between $600 and $700 a tonne,\" Vesey added. \\nREVISITING DESIGNS\\nThe cost hikes are, however, not likely to halt new construction. Wall Street analysts now expect four multi-billion-dollar plants to be approved this year, versus a previous projection of two or three plants. \\nU.S. LNG exports in March rose to a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), versus an average 9.7 bcfd for calendar 2021, according to U.S. government data. \\nBut soaring raw materials prices may lead to a revision in contracts and financing needs, weakening potential returns.\\nLake Charles LNG's 2015 regulatory filing estimated construction goods and services would cost $1.68 billion and wages would be $2.72 billion. \\nThe Energy Transfer's Lake Charles, Louisiana, project would need \"an updated cost assessment,\" investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co said last month. \\nEnergy Transfer did not reply to requests for comment.\\nHowever, it told U.S. energy regulators on March 7 it was working with the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider Bechtel that will \"enable EPC pricing updates\" this summer. It did not offer an estimated cost increase. \\nTellurian added $300 million to its original $15.2 billion EPC contract with Bechtel for Driftwood LNG, spokesperson Joi Lecznar said. She did not say when the increase went into effect or if another is pending. \\nBechtel declined to comment. \\nLIKE LEGO\\nTo cut costs, newer plant developers including New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) are employing modular liquefaction units made by Baker Hughes Inc that are prebuilt in factories and can be snapped together like Legos. \\nNew Fortress claims it could put together a plant atop an offshore drilling rig in 12 months. \\n\"Using modular units has the potential to offer savings in both time and money compared with building a complex large-scale project from scratch,\" said Robert Songer, LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS. \\nSean Morgan, a director at investment bank Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) ISI, pointed out that the designs allow for \"lower upfront capital expenditure commitments by capital providers and the project builders.\" \\nLNG developer Venture Global is installing 18 modular units at its Calcasieu Pass project in Louisiana. The project's $580 per tonne cost is about 26% cheaper than early LNG export terminals, according Ross Wyeno, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.\\n\\nSuch designs slash on-site construction labor costs, said Paul Varello, chairman of Commonwealth LNG, which is targeting a 2023 financial decision for its proposed U.S. Gulf Coast plant. \\n\"One benefit is their tendency to not be as sensitive to inflationary impacts,\" he said. \"By having that savings, we're able to be competitive on our prices.\" \\n \\n</td>\n",

The Board has concluded that each and every proposal to date has been unacceptable, failing to reflect the fair value of the Group, and confirms that THG is not currently in receipt of any approaches.\"\\nMoulding, whose performance has come under criticism due to the poor performance of the group's stock since it listed in London 19 months ago, added that he would continue executing the group's existing strategy.\\nBy 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), THG stock in London was up 7.5% at a seven-week high. It's still lost around five-sixths of its value since listing.\\nTHG's quarterly figures were slightly better than expected, and the company upheld its prior guidance for an increase of between 22%-25% in currency-adjusted revenue this year. Revenue was up 17% on the year, with the beauty segment growing 19.7% and the nutrition segment growing 12.6%. The number of websites powered by the group's technology rose to 202 from 187 at the end of the fourth quarter.\\nIt warned though that its margins may come under pressure as it tries to absorb at least some of the cost pressure currently affecting it. The company said it will aim to raise prices \"at a lower rate to underlying input costs.\"  \\n\"We believe the recent and rapid inflationary environment is largely transitory, and THG will, as far as possible, continue to shield consumers from these adverse macro-economic conditions,\" Moulding said, going against the recent trend of increasingly alarmist rhetoric about inflation from companies across the spectrum. Moulding noted the importance of retaining customers, saying that 78% of its revenue comes from repeat business. Most of that comes from high-frequency purchases in the beauty and nutrition segments.</td>\n",

Analysts expected 5.1%. The figures exclude Russia, where Nestle has halted some activities.\\nFood and beverage companies have been raising prices amid strong demand as consumers return to offices and eat outside of home more often. The sector has benefited from resilient appetite for basic necessities while European industrial companies and carmakers suffer from higher costs and supply-chain bottlenecks.\\nRead more: War Hits Europe Car Sales Recovery, Undermines Manufacturers\\nNestle shares gained as much as 1.9% in early trading. \\nRival Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) reported its fastest quarterly sales growth in seven years Wednesday, while Heineken (OTC:HEINY) NV’s unusually big price increases helped revenue increase by 36% in the period. While the ability to raise prices on consumers may blunt the impact of higher raw material costs, the risk is that it may eventually drive some shoppers to cheaper alternatives. \\n“We are getting used to companies beating consensus sales growth expectations this quarter -- L’Oreal, Danone and Heineken have all done it -- but in our view Nestle is the most impressive yet,” James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC, wrote. He said that the company’s shipment growth is admirable in the context of such strong pricing.\\nThe war in Ukraine has exacerbated food inflation because the country is a major supplier of wheat and sunflower oil. Meanwhile inflation in prices for coffee, plastic and shipping are cutting into profitability at the maker of KitKat chocolate and San Pellegrino water. \\n“Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said in a statement.\\nSchneider had faced criticism for continuing to do business in Russia, with Ukrainian politicians even calling him out by name and demanding a full exit. Nestle eventually suspended the vast majority of its production in the country, but Schneider maintains that access to food is a basic right. Nestle now focuses on selling essential products like infant formula and medical nutrition there.\\nThe CEO stuck to his forecast for revenue growth to decelerate to about 5% in 2022. Schneider said in February the company should achieve its previous long-term guidance in coming years, which is for annual revenue increases of 5% to 6%.\\nThe maker of Purina pet food repeated that profitability may decline for a second year in 2022, with its adjusted operating profit margin expected to be 17% to 17.5% this year.

The gauge is now just 2.2% above its March 15 close, when a historic rout pushed the benchmark to the lowest since June 2020. \\nInvestors who had expected authorities to ramp up monetary stimulus have since been underwhelmed, with Wednesday’s decision by Chinese banks to keep lending rates unchanged serving as the latest disappointment.

Falling demand for leveraged trade indicates sluggish risk appetite. History suggests stock leverage demand tends to rise alongside a market rebound.\\n“Matters have taken a turn for the worse with the latest round of the Covid-19 resurgence that has led to lockdowns of key economic hubs,” BofA Securities Inc. strategists led by Ritesh Samadhiya wrote in a note this week. “A significant ramp up in policy easing is paramount in attaining the ‘about 5.5%’ growth target.”\\nFleeing Foreigners\\nOverseas investors are pulling money from mainland shares as lockdowns amplify growth risks and the yuan’s weakness against the dollar falls to multi-month lows. Foreigners offloaded 45 billion yuan ($7 billion) of shares onshore through the stock connect in March, the most in two years. Net outflows amounted to 6 billion yuan so far this month through Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \\nREAD: IMF Says China’s Outflows Show Deepening Divergence With U.S.\\nDwindling Trading\\nDaily turnover on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges dipped below 800 billion yuan earlier this week, marking the lowest level since May last year. The slump underscores investor caution as China sticks to its strict Covid Zero approach. Decreasing trading turnover in a down-trending market could indicate a short-term bottom, at least according to past occurrences, though investors say a meaningful rebound is unlikely barring a shift in Covid policy.  \\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil a new strategy for dealing with drug addiction and overdoses on Thursday that aims to expand access to medications for opioid overdoses, increase funding for law enforcement, and expand sanctions against traffickers.\\nThe Biden administration is keen to show it is taking action on a worsening U.S. opioid crisis, which fueled more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\\n\"That's an American life lost every five minutes around the clock,\" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House.\\n\"For too many years, the overdose crisis has been unraveling the very social fabric of our nation and destroying American lives and livelihoods,\" Gupta told reporters on a press call.\\nThe National Drug Control Strategy, which Biden will send to Congress on Thursday, seeks to double treatment admissions for populations that are most at risk of overdose deaths and ensure universal access to medications for opioid use disorder by 2025.\\nCurrently, key tools like naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, and syringe service programs are often restricted or underfunded. There are legal barriers limiting access to naloxone in some states, and even in others the drug is not always available to those most at risk of an overdose.\\nPatients are more likely to receive a naloxone prescription if they had a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence along with an overdose compared with individuals who had those diagnoses without an overdose.\\n\\nThe administration also aims to triple the number of drug traffickers it sanctions and increase border security, said Gupta. Biden in December signed two executive orders aimed at fighting drug trafficking and criminal networks.\\nOne order allowed for new sanctions on Chinese companies trading ingredients of the opioid drug fentanyl and on criminal gangs in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. \\n \\n</td>\n",

The FAA did not notify police in advance about the approved military flight for military appreciation night at Nationals Stadium, Capitol police told congressional staff in a letter.\\nThe FAA said late Wednesday it would \"conduct a thorough and expeditious review of the events this evening and share updates. We know our actions affect others, especially in our nation's capital region, and we must communicate early and often with our law enforcement partners.\"\\nThe FAA statement did not say whether the agency had alerted Capitol Police to the flight, which took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\\nThe Golden Knights parachuted into the Washington Nationals' baseball stadium, Nationals Park, a little over a mile away from the U.S. Capitol, before returning to the Maryland base.\\n\"The unnecessary panic caused by this apparent negligence was particularly harmful for members, staff and institutional workers still grappling with the trauma of the attack on their workplace on January 6th,\" Pelosi said in a statement late on Wednesday, referring to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\n\"Congress looks forward to reviewing the results of a thorough after-action review that determines what precisely went wrong today and who at the Federal Aviation Administration will be held accountable for this outrageous and frightening mistake,\" Pelosi said.\\nCapitol Police said in the email to some congressional staff that it \"will be working with our airspace partners to address the notification issues.\"\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>By Jonathan Allen\\n(Reuters) -South Carolina's Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of a condemned man planned for next week that would have been the first firing-squad execution in the United States in more than a decade.\\nRichard Moore, 57, was convicted in 2001 of murdering a store clerk in a 1999 robbery. The jury voted to recommend he be sentenced to death.\\nSouth Carolina's highest court agreed to Moore's request to stay his execution date, set earlier this month for April 29, because of his ongoing legal challenges to his sentence and to the Southern state's execution methods.\\nThe court's order, which was signed by all five justices, did not state the grounds for the stay, but said \"a more detailed order\" would soon follow. A spokesperson for the state's Department of Corrections said the department was awaiting the fuller order before commenting.\\nSeveral state governments and the federal government have struggled in recent years to obtain lethal-injection drugs, in part because pharmaceutical companies generally forbid the sale of their medicines for use in executions. \\nAs a result, execution officials have had to substitute those specific drugs with more easily obtained ones or revive older execution methods, such as gas asphyxiation or the electric chair. The new or revised execution protocols have drawn an array of legal challenges from people on death rows across the country, bolstered by a number of ghastly \"botched\" executions by lethal injection. \\nMoore and other death row inmates who are suing the South Carolina Department of Corrections in a lower-level state court say the execution methods available to them violate the South Carolina constitution, which forbids cruel or unusual punishments. Unlike the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment, the state's constitution explicitly forbids corporal punishment.\\nSouth Carolina last carried out an execution in 2011, using lethal injection. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a law in 2021 making electrocution the state's main method of execution, and added a firing squad as an option.\\nEarlier this month, the Department of Corrections asked Moore to choose either to be killed by electric chair or by a firing squad after telling him that execution officials were unable to secure lethal-injection drugs.\\nLast week, Moore chose a firing squad, a method that has been used only three times in the United States since 1950, and is viewed by some as a quicker, more painless and less easily botched death, if harder for witnesses to watch.\\nThose three firing squad executions were all carried out by the state of Utah -- in 1977, 1996 and 2010 -- according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.\\n\"I do not believe or concede that either the firing squad or electrocution is legal or constitutional,\" Moore said in a statement informing the Department of Corrections of his choice. He said that if he refused to make a choice, the department had said it would default to the electric chair.\\n\\nLindsey Vann, a lawyer for Moore, said she was glad the state Supreme Court was \"allowing for more time\" for Moore's cases to be reviewed.\\nMoore also sought the stay to allow him to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to find the death penalty excessive in his case. His lawyers have argued that because he entered the store unarmed and used the clerk's own gun after grabbing it in a scuffle, that the murder was not premeditated.\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "3    (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. West Coast is importing gasoline at a near-record pace this month to help ease supply constraints amid eye-popping pump prices just ahead of the peak summer driving season.\\nAround 120,000 barrels a day of gasoline and blending components are expected to reach the U.S. West Coast in April, including 95,000 barrels a day that have already arrived, marking the second-highest monthly level since oil analytics firm Vortexa began tracking the data in January 2016. The region imported 150,000 barrels a day in May 2019.\\nThese imports underscore the need to replenish supply ahead of what’s shaping up to be a tight summer for gasoline. A heavy maintenance season that’s just now winding down left West Coast refinery rates at 84% last week. That has put additional pressure on drivers, with Californians paying more than anywhere else in the U.S. for gasoline.\\n Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) is due to carry out major maintenance in June at its Richmond, California refinery, one of the West Coast’s largest, after a labor strike delayed the original schedule in April. This will tighten gasoline supplies during peak demand months. Meanwhile, signs that high fuel prices may have deterred some drivers in March have now evaporated with implied U.S. gasoline demand reverting to the seasonal rising norm, pushing inventories below the five-year average for this time of year nationally and on the West Coast.\\nThe jump in imports is driven by increased volumes from Asia, which accounted for about 60% of the monthly volume. Indian refineries have been operating at above 100% capacity in order to capture high export margins, while China is ramping up fuel exports as a Covid-19 resurgence weighs on local demand.\\nPump prices in California are still hovering near record levels, while the rest of the country saw a reprieve earlier this month. Californians are now paying an average of $5.689 a gallon for gasoline, 4% lower than the peak of $5.919 a gallon reached on March 29, according to auto club AAA.

It involves the capture of CO2 from fuel combustion or industrial processes, transporting it via ship or pipeline, to be stored underground in geological formations or used as a resource to create products.\\nLarge oil companies have been investing to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a relevant business as international bodies such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) point the technology as key to mitigate the effects of global warming.\\n\\nExxon is under public pressure to reduce its total emissions as its energy transition strategy does not include renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. It has recently hired Dan Ammann, who led the Cruise self-driving unit of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) until December, to lead its Low Carbon business starting on May 1. \\nU.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), developing the world's largest project to extract CO2 from the air, has previously estimated CCS could become a $3-5 trillion global industry. The technology could generate as much in earnings and cash flow for Occidental than oil and gas today, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at a conference in March. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "8    OPEC told the International Monetary Fund's steering committee on Thursday that the surge in oil prices was largely due to the Ukraine crisis, in the latest signal that the producer group would not take further action to add supply.\\nIn a statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) seen by Reuters, OPEC said the price of global benchmark Brent crude had averaged near $98 a barrel in the first quarter, up about $18 from the last three months of 2021.\\n\"Oil prices have been on the rise, particularly in March this year ... mainly due to the escalating geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and concerns this might result in large oil supply shortages, amid trade dislocations,\" OPEC told the IMFC.\\nThe IMFC is part of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's Board of Governors. \\nOPEC, which took part in a meeting of the IMFC last year, has been resisting calls by the United States and European Union to pump more oil to cool prices, which reached a 14-year peak above $139 last month after Washington and Brussels imposed sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.\\nOPEC+, which consists of OPEC and other producers including Russia, will raise output by about 432,000 barrels per day in May, as part of a gradual unwinding of output cuts made during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nOPEC said that OPEC+ had shown its commitment to ensuring that oil supply and demand fundamentals were in balance during the Ukraine crisis to support the global economy.\\nOPEC also highlighted the negative short-term impact of the Ukraine crisis and ongoing pandemic, adding: \"The strong rise in commodity prices, in combination with ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19-related logistical constraints are fuelling already high global inflation\". \\n \\n

       "9    Some U.S. oilfield firms whose Venezuelan operations were frozen by sanctions are joining an appeal to Washington for authorizations to restart oil drilling in the South American country, according to eight sources with knowledge of the talks.\\nIf they are allowed to resume work, Venezuela could quickly ramp up production capacity beyond 1 million barrels per day (bpd), analysts said. \\nThe new supply could also fill a void left by U.S. ban on Russian energy imports over its invasion of Ukraine that has contributed to crude prices above $100 per barrel. \\nSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes and Weatherford International (NASDAQ:WFRD) have been barred since 2019 from helping Venezuelan state-run PDVSA and its joint ventures produce oil. Any easing by the U.S. Treasury Department of a restricted license the four companies share with  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) could let them expand operations.\\nSince the United States first imposed oil trading sanctions on Venezuela, many firms removed equipment and staff and wrote off hundreds of millions dollars of their assets there. But over a dozen rigs remain stored near the nation's largest oilfields.\\nA high-level meeting last month between U.S. and Venezuelan officials opened the door to a possible return of Venezuela's oil to the United States. Sanctions were first imposed in 2019 to choke oil exports and deprive Caracas of its main source of revenue in its bid to see the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \\nThe talks coincided with Washington's ban on Russian oil imports, a measure that will take full effect this week, potentially hurting U.S. refiners and contributing to rising fuel prices. \\nOil companies that still have a presence in Venezuela could promptly reactivate equipment in the country, the sources said, potentially reviving crude output, which remains at 40% of pre-sanction levels.\\n\"If PDVSA's joint ventures are seeking to obtain licenses to operate, they will need the oil services companies,\" Reinaldo Quintero, president of Venezuela's Petroleum Chamber told Reuters. \\nSeveral U.S.-based and local oilfield firms have approached the chamber to express their desire to resume work in Venezuela, he added, declining to provide details on the talks.\\nBaker Hughes said it would not comment on speculation or future activity. Schlumberger said its policies do not permit lobbying or political contributions. Halliburton declined to comment on future plans in Venezuela. \\nInvestment firm Amos Global Energy has submitted requests to the United States to participate in Venezuela's energy sector and has an oilfield company ready to provide services if granted, founder Ali Moshiri said.\\nWeatherford and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment.\\nLINING UP \\nChevron has requested authorization from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to take operating control of its projects with PDVSA. The oil major also has begun readying a team for returning Venezuelan crude to the United States.\\nBut U.S officials are still debating whether to revamp the current license, set to expire in June, sources in Washington familiar with the talks said. The move would be widely seen as an easing of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. \\nProspects for a change dimmed after an outcry from Republican lawmakers and some of Biden's fellow Democrats following the Caracas talks.

A gradual phasing out would give time for trade flows to adjust in a more orderly fashion and so the impact on price would be more limited compared to an immediate ban,” added ING.\\nElsewhere, Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stated on Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.\\nTurning to the demand side, investors continue to monitor the COVID outbreak and associated lockdowns in China, the world’s largest import of crude, as the country struggles to contain a surge in cases including the first fatalities since the original outbreak.\\nCrude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed a draw of 8 million barrels last week, suggesting demand remains strong in the world’s largest consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "12   (Bloomberg) -- Gold declined to near the lowest in almost two weeks, as U.S. bond yields rebounded, curbing the appeal of the non-interest bearing metal. \\nBullion has flipped between gains and losses each day so far this week, and fell as much as 0.8% on Thursday as 10-Year yields rose amid a debate around whether inflation is peaking. Real rates turned positive for the first time in two years this week, a sign investors believe the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates to cool inflation without severely hurting the economy.\\nStill, a Fed anecdotal survey showed inflationary pressures have remained strong, clouding the outlook for future growth. Gold prices are proving resilient -- gaining about 6% this year -- as haven demand stays robust with investors focusing on political and economic risk. That’s supporting purchases through gold-backed exchange-traded funds, which have seen holdings rise to the highest in more than a year, according to initial data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n“While higher interest rates may weigh, worries about inflation, growth, and increased market volatility, together with the war in Ukraine, remain the key reasons why asset managers continue to accumulate exposure,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.\\nSpot gold was down 0.7% at $1,943.71 an ounce by 1 p.m. in London. Platinum and Silver also fell, while Palladium edged higher.

       "13   Raise your air conditioner's temperature, adjust your boiler settings, drive slower and swap short-haul flights for trains: some of the International Energy Agency's advice on how consumers can help reduce reliance on Russian energy and cut their bills.\\nEnergy saving has long been needed to meet climate goals, but months of soaring energy prices and a scramble to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have pushed the issue up the political agenda.\\nIn a guide launched with the European Commission on Thursday, the Paris-based IEA recommended Europeans work from home where possible, share cars, avoid driving on Sundays in large cities, and use bikes, public transport or walk more.\\nThe IEA said if followed, the recommendations could save 450 euros per year on the energy bill of a typical EU household, depending on factors such as the type of home and car owned. \\nJust turning down the thermostat by 1C could shave 70 euros off a household's heating bill, while driving on average 10 km per hour slower on motorways could save another 60 euros per year on fuel, it said.\\nIf done EU-wide, the measures could save 220 million barrels of oil per year and 17 billion cubic metres of gas, the IEA said. \\nThe 27-country EU has pledged to stop Russian fuels by 2027, but in the short term remains dependent on Moscow for 26% of its oil imports and 40% of its gas

       "18   (Bloomberg) -- Oil was little changed as traders assessed the lingering threat to demand from lockdowns in China against a series of challenges to supply.\\nWest Texas Intermediate was near $102 a barrel in early Asian trading after alternating between daily gains and losses this week. China’s authorities are struggling to eradicate a fresh wave of Covid-19 in key cities and strict curbs have eroded mobility, including for the nation’s fleet of trucks.\\nWith the war in Ukraine nearing the end of its second month, European Union members are edging toward cutting dependence on Russian crude. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country plans to stop imports by the end of the year, Reuters reported. At the same time, Russian output has fallen, and protests in Libya have crimped production, tightening the market.\\nOil has rallied by more than a third this year, hitting the highest since 2008 after Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor sent shockwaves through the global energy market.

       "20   The world needs to find $1.3 trillion of incremental investment by 2030 to boost all types of energy output and infrastructure from renewables to oil and gas to avoid an energy crunch, U.S. bank JP Morgan said in its first annual energy outlook.\\n\"Our main finding is that by 2030, energy demand growth will exceed supply growth by circa 20% based on current trends, primarily driven by emerging economies and their efforts to develop and lift their citizens out of poverty,\" strategists Marko Kolanovic and Christyan Malek said.\\nInvestment will need to be inclusive of all fuels, including oil and gas, renewables and nuclear, with oil demand alone expected to grow by around 10% by 2030 and gas by 18%.\\n\"Not all fuels are made equal, and for the most part (and within this

       "24   By Lucy Craymer\\nWELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in three decades last quarter, underlining the need for the central bank to stay on its hawkish course to contain price pressures without tipping the economy into recession.\\nThe New Zealand dollar slipped after the data showed inflation was not quite as hot as feared though, slightly softening expectations the central bank would again hike rates by 50 basis points in May.\\nAnnual inflation rose 6.9% in the first quarter from 5.9% in the fourth quarter, the fastest since a 7.6% clip in the June quarter of 1990, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement on Thursday\\nCPI rose 1.8% in the quarter ending March from a 1.4% rise in the fourth quarter. But the data was below economists’ expectations in a Reuters poll that forecast a 2.0% rise for the quarter, and an annual rise of 7.1%.\\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points to 1.50% last Wednesday, its fourth increase in a row. It has signalled that further hikes will be needed if it wants to get ahead of inflation.\\nBROAD BASED PRICE RISES\\nInflation pressures were broad based with domestic price pressures continuing to intensify. Statistics New Zealand data showed rising prices for food, petrol, construction and housing.\\n\"This domestic inflation is the kind that doesn't go away quickly,\" ANZ Bank economists said in a research note. \"This continued rise in domestic inflation pressures only reinforces the need for ongoing interest rate rises by the RBNZ.\"\\nANZ believes higher interest rates will squeeze indebted households this year and engineering a soft landing for the overheated economy could be challenging, especially with the housing market already softening.\\nThe kiwi dollar eased 0.4% to $0.6772, from $0.6804 just before the data hit dealing screens. Two-year swap rates dipped as much as six basis points to 3.52%.\\n\\nWith global inflation expected to stay elevated for some time, and prices of commodities and goods affected by supply issues, economists expect RBNZ to hike interest rates again. \\n\"Uncertainty is high but we could still see a 7% annual inflation print delivered in Q2 of this year,\" ASB Bank economists wrote in a note. It added the bigger issue for them was not when inflation would peak, but how persistent it was. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "25   (Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s early trade data indicate exports are set to post strong gains in April, underscoring the resilience of global commerce to upheavals caused by war in Ukraine and China’s lockdowns.\\nExports advanced 16.9% in the first 20 days of the month from a year earlier, led by semiconductors, the customs office reported Thursday. Imports advanced by 25.5%.\\nSouth Korea releases trade data earlier than most countries and its 20-day performance is closely watched as an indicator of global demand due to Korean companies’ deep integration into the world’s supply chains.\\nExports are a major component of South Korea’s economy, which is expected to miss growth estimates this year as inflationary pressures overshadow consumption worldwide.

       "28   By Andrea Shalal\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -A White House adviser on Thursday suggested the United States could lower tariffs imposed on a host of non-strategic Chinese goods such as bicycles or apparel to help combat inflation.\\nDeputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said tariffs imposed by the former Trump government may have given the administration some negotiating leverage, but these tariffs served no strategic purpose, and China had similar non-strategic retaliatory tariffs in place.\\n\"So that's the opportunity,\" he told an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee. \"It could be that in this moment of elevated inflation and China having its own very serious supply chain concerns ... maybe there's something we can do there.\" \\nInflation is a critical concern for President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings are falling as the costs of energy, food and other staples increase, and his Democrats are at serious risk of losing their majorities in Congress in midterm congressional elections in November.\\nU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has restarted an exclusion process that could lower tariffs on some Chinese goods, but has made no major moves to wholesale remove tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.\\nThe United States could use tariffs to advance strategic priorities such as strengthening critical supply chains and maintaining U.S. preeminence in foundational technologies and to support national security, Singh said.\\n\"For product categories that are not implicated by those objectives, there's not much of a case for those tariffs being in place,\" he said. \"Why do we have tariffs on bicycles or apparel or underwear?\" \\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in December said lowering Trump-era tariffs on imported goods from China through a revived exclusion process could help ease some inflationary pressures, although she stressed it would be no \"game-changer.\" \\nSingh's comments come as Washington is urging Beijing to refrain from undermining sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine.\\nSingh said the Biden administration believed Chinese banks and companies were largely being cautious and steering clear of helping Russia to evade Western sanctions, and underscored China's interest in continuing to trade with the West.\\n\\nSingh said it was clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping wanted to achieve supremacy through economic and technological dominance, but there were areas where the two countries could cooperate, including to combat climate change.\\nHe said Xi was likely to continue to rely on state-owned enterprises and national champions, and they would continue to receive very heavy government subsidies.\\n \\n

       "29   (Reuters) -Rite Aid Corp said on Thursday it had rejected a buyout proposal from private-equity firm Spear Point Capital Management, which valued the drugstore chain at about $3.6 billion, including debt. \\nRite Aid (NYSE:RAD)'s board said the proposal was not credible as it had no evidence of financing and required multiple months of exclusivity, among other reasons.\\nSpear Point said it had also offered to enlist the services of its data valuation and monetization partner, Silverback United, to value Rite Aid when it presented the bid, and also offered to share the valuation with the drugstore chain so it can seek a higher value.\\nHowever, as Rite Aid rejected the offer, Spear Point said it plans to discuss with the company's shareholders and management about how Rite Aid is \"significantly undervalued and explore management's inability to unlock that value\".\\nShares in Rite Aid closed 6% lower at $7.68 on Thursday.\\nThe New York Post had reported late on Wednesday the private-equity firm had made an offer valuing Rite Aid at more than $800 million.\\n\\nRite Aid had a market capitalization of $428.4 million as of Thursday's close.\\nThe company

       "32   Canada's ruling Liberals are eyeing more measures to curb housing speculation after introducing a foreign buyer ban and heftier taxes on property flippers in their budget earlier this month, the housing minister said on Thursday. \\nMinister Ahmed Hussen, asked about imposing further measures to slow investor activity such as requiring larger down-payments for second, third or subsequent homes, did not rule out the option.\\n\"We are curbing speculation by doing a number of things ... but also we haven't closed the door to further measures,\" Hussen told Reuters in an interview.

The Fed chairman also backed the idea of the central bank hiking aggressively at the start of the tightening cycle, or front loading more than one 50 basis-point hike at future meetings.    \\nPointing to the minutes of the Fed's March meeting, Powell said that \"many on the committee thought it would be appropriate for there to be one or more 50 basis point hike.\"\\nTraders expect the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points at each of the next three meetings in an attempt to curb demand, and overall inflation, which is well above the central bank's 2% target.  \\nLast week’s data showed that U.S. inflation rose at the fastest rate since 1981. It increased 8.5% over the 12 months to March.\\nIn the wake of more a hawkish Fed, many are worried that the U.S. central bank could overshoot on monetary policy, slowing the economy by too much into a recession. The Fed chief stressed, however, that central bank isn't on a one-way monetary policy tightening mission and it seeks to deliver a soft landing.     \\n\"Our goal is to use our tools to get demand and supply back in sync so that inflation moves down and does so without a slowdown that amounts to a recession,\" Powell said, though admitted that it was going to be \"very challenging.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "43   (Reuters) -The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank's board of directors has begun a search for a new bank president to succeed Charles Evans, who reaches the mandatory retirement age next January, and on Thursday announced he'd be leaving his post early next year. \\nThe bank has hired recruiting firm Diversified Search Group to assist on the nationwide effort, it said in a statement.\\nWhoever gets the job will help set interest rates for the world's biggest economy as it faces the fastest inflation in 40 years -- made worse by the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War Two and a pandemic that has killed millions and continues to disrupt global supply chains as well as daily life in much of the world. \\nIt is also a time of unprecedented change among the ranks of U.S. monetary policymakers themselves, a group of 19 when all vacancies are filled. The Fed has historically been dominated by white men. With as many as seven new policymakers coming on by early next year, that will change.\\nThe U.S. Senate is expected to confirm two new members of the Fed's Board of Governors in coming weeks, both Black economists joining what is now an all-white leadership. University of Michigan provost Susan Collins will take the top job at the Boston Fed this summer, making her the first Black woman to lead a regional Fed bank. \\nThe Dallas Fed, which like the Boston Fed lost its chief last fall amid a trading and ethics scandal, is in the middle of its own search for a new president. And Kansas City Fed chief Esther George will, like Evans, reach the regional banks' mandatory retirement age of 65 at the start of next year, and that bank will also need to seek a new leader. \\nEvans, who started at the Chicago Fed in 1991, is the longest-serving current Fed policymaker and has been an influential voice at the U.S. central bank since he took his current job in 2007. \\n\\nHe was a key architect of Fed communications in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession as the bank sought to anchor market expectations for the path of interest rates, and helped develop the Fed's \"dot plot\" of policymaker rate forecasts. \\nRegional Fed bank presidents are picked by the non-bank directors of those banks, with input and approval by the Fed's Board of Directors.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Across multiple categories. In European food, it is called Nestle,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.\\nOutside Europe, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged past Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, as higher prices helped insulate the electric vehicle maker from supply chain chaos and rising costs. [nL3N2WI3AV]\\nThe big U.S. airlines United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc reported that high fares have not dented demand for domestic travel. Both airlines forecast a return to profitability. \\n\"The demand environment is very strong,\" American Airlines Chief Executive Robert Isom said in a statement.\\nBut while cheering investors, with Nestle, ABB and Akzo Nobel enjoying share price gains, the strategy is stirring worries about households' ability to cope and the outlook for the rest of the year.\\nRising interest rates and lagging pay deals are squeezing consumers, who are seeing their disposable incomes shrink and shopping bills rise.\\nThere have been some signs in U.S. retail data that consumers have begun cutting back on discretionary spending amid high inflation and companies that thrived during the pandemic have lost some of their edge.\\nOn Tuesday, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) blamed inflation, the war in Ukraine and fierce competition on a loss of subscribers for the first time in more than a decade.\\nAnd while Nescafe owner Nestle was among the winners on Thursday, reporting a 7.6% rise in organic sales during the first three months of the year, its CEO later warned that inflation has made its profit margin target more challenging.\\nNestle beat a 5.0% average forecast for the sales measure that strips out currency swings and M&A deals in a company-compiled consensus thanks to price increases of 5.2%.\\n\"We stepped up pricing in a responsible manner and saw sustained consumer demand,\" the Swiss company, whose products include Purina pet food and Nespresso, said. \\nMORE HIKES LIKELY\\nStill the world's biggest food group said the current price rises were unlikely to be the last.\\n\"Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year,\" Nestle added.\\nFrench peer Danone, whose product line up includes Activia yoghurt and Evian water, said it was also ready for further rounds of price increases \"if needed\" after reporting a 7.1% sales increase late on Wednesday.\\nThe world's biggest yoghurt maker benefited from price increases at the start of the year as well as easier comparisons and stronger demand for baby formula in China.\\nHigher prices could be a sensitive topic in its French home market where the cost of living crisis sets the tone for the presidential runoff between incumbent Emmanuel Macron and his right-wing challenger Marine Le Pen.\\nPrice rises have also not hurt demand for Dutch paint and coatings maker Akzo Nobel, which beat quarterly core earnings estimates on Thursday while reporting a 17% increase in prices compared with a year earlier.\\nCEO Thierry Vanlancker said that the group's \"vigorous pricing initiatives\" had helped it manage \"the unprecedented variable cost inflation that impacted our industry during the quarter\".\\nBeyond the consumer area, factory robots and industrial drive maker ABB also reported a 21% jump in orders during its first quarter despite increasing prices.\\nCEO Bjorn Rosengren said there were was no end in sight to price increases for components and metals, as well as rising transport costs.\\nThis meant ABB would have to continue to lift prices to deal with it, he said, although there was no sign of customers holding back from equipping their factories with new products. \\n\"They are still placing orders, I guess they are accepting it,\" Rosengren told reporters. \"We are not the only one lifting prices, everyone is doing that in the market. That is the new reality.\"\\n\\nAlso on Thursday, Husqvarna, the world's biggest maker of gardening power equipment, said it was raising prices further this month in response to rising supply and energy costs and said it had no indication retailers were holding back. \\n\"They accept the price increases,\" Henric Andersson, CEO of the Swedish group told Reuters after the earnings report. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "49   (Reuters) -San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Thursday said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets.\\nDaly's support for a path of policy tightening that would bring borrowing costs to the Fed's estimate of the neutral level in nine months has helped cement expectations in recent weeks for interest rate hikes in bigger-than-usual 50 basis-point increments at the Fed's next couple of policy meetings. \\n\"Is it 50, is it 25, is it 75? Those are things that I'll deliberate with my colleagues, but my own starting point is we don't want to go so quickly or so abruptly that we surprise Americans\" already dealing with 40-year-high inflation, Daly told Yahoo Finance. \\n\\n\"I'm watching over this year to see how much our move to neutral restrains the economy, along with the repair of supply chains and the fiscal rolloff,\" all of which should contribute to easing inflation, she said.\\nWhether rates will then need to rise beyond neutral where they would begin to actually restrict economic growth, Daly said, \"is an open question and one I don't want to get prematurely to before we see the data.\"\\n \\n

Sotomayor pointed out that as the island does not have voting representation in Congress, its people cannot rely on Congress to recognize their rights.\\n\"Equal treatment of citizens should not be left to the vagaries of the political process,\" Sotomayor wrote.\\nA provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is part of Democratic-backed social spending legislation that has stalled in Congress. \\n'A DEVASTATING DAY'\\nJose Luis Vaello Madero, the disabled 67-year-old man at the center of the case, received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The U.S. government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico.\\n\"It is unfortunate the court failed to see the discrimination faced by the most needy Puerto Rican Americans whose only distinguishing feature is that they choose to remain in Puerto Rico, their home on U.S. soil. This is a devastating day for Mr. Vaello Madero and for Puerto Rico,\" said Hermann Ferre, Vaello Madero's lawyer. \\nThe Justice Department declined comment.\\nMany Puerto Ricans have long complained that the island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the most-populous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people.\\nSSI benefits are available to American citizens living in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.\\nThe Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. Those rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. \\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch in a separate opinion said the court in a future case should overturn the Insular Cases, saying they \"rest on racial stereotypes\" and \"deserve no place in our law.\"\\n\\nCongress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the SSI program. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different benefits program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. \\nThe government's appeal originally was filed by former President Donald Trump's administration.

       "54   The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell moderately last week, still suggesting that April was another month of strong job growth.\\nThe report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed unemployment rolls shrinking to the lowest level in 52 years in the first week of April, reinforcing the tightening labor market conditions. An acute shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low, helping to fuel inflation, and forcing the Federal Reserve to adopt a restrictive monetary policy stance.\\nThe U.S. central bank faces a tricky balancing act of slowing demand without plunging the economy into recession. So far, households continue to spend and businesses are hungry for workers to meet consumer demand. \\nBut trouble could be brewing, with other data on Thursday showing a measure of future business activity in the mid-Atlantic region tumbling in April to a level last seen 14 years ago, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession.\\n\"Economic growth may eventually hit a wall without more workers for companies to hire, but not today,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. \"Jobless claims at near-record lows mean worker wages will continue to go up and up, guaranteeing that inflation remains more persistent and at more worrisome levels for longer than Fed officials believe.\" \\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 184,000 for the week ended April 16. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 180,000 applications for the latest week. Claims plunged to a more than 53-year low of 166,000 during the week ending March 19. \\nThere is probably limited scope for further declines.\\nLast week, applications tumbled by 7,656 in Missouri. There were also substantial declines in Ohio, Texas, New York and Michigan, which offset increases in Connecticut and California. \\nThe Fed in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first rate hike in more than three years. Economists expect a half-percentage-point rate increase next month, and for the U.S. central bank to soon start trimming its asset holdings.\\nClaims, which have dropped from a record high of 6.137 million in early April 2020, will be closely watched for signs of whether rising borrowing costs are curbing demand. \\nStocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\\nWORKER SHORTAGE\\nDemand for labor is holding strong for now. The Fed's Beige Book, based on information collected on or before April 11 from the central bank's business contacts, showed on Wednesday that \"demand for workers continued to be strong across most districts and industry sectors,\" but noted \"hiring was held back by the overall lack of available workers.\"\\nThere were a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February. The unemployment rate is at 3.6%, just one-tenth of a percentage point above its pre-pandemic level.\\nBut there are signs labor supply will soon improve. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 58,000 to 1.417 million during the week ending April 9. The was the lowest level for the so-called continuing claims since February 1970.\\nThe demand-supply imbalance is stoking wage inflation. A second report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed 80% of firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported wages and compensation costs had increased over the past three months.\\nA majority of firms in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, said they had adjusted their 2022 budgets for wages and compensation since the beginning of the year, with 65% reporting they were planning to increase wages and compensation by \"more than originally planned,\" and a third intending \"to increase wages and compensation sooner than originally planned.\" \\nThe Philadelphia Fed's business activity index dropped to 17.6 this month from 27.4 in March. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector. \\nManufacturers' assessment of business activity over the next six months was downbeat, with the index dropping 15 points to 8.2, the lowest reading since December 2008. \\nStill, firms hired more workers, with the survey's gauge of factory employment reaching an all-time high. Companies planned to retain their workforces over the next six months.\\nLast week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the March and April payrolls survey periods. \\n\\nEconomists are expecting strong employment growth in April. Payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in March, marking the 11th straight month of employment gains in excess of 400,000.\\n\"The labor market remains in excellent shape as the spring quarter begins,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "57   By Phuong Nguyen and Fanny Potkin\\nHANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Vietnam is preparing new rules requiring social media firms to take down content it deems illegal within 24 hours, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\\nThe planned amendments to current law will cement Vietnam, a $1 billion market for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), as one of the world's most stringent regimes for social media firms and will strengthen the ruling Communist Party's hand as it cracks down on \"anti-state\" activity.\\nThe 24-hour time frame to take down \"illegal content and services\" will not have a grace period, while active \"illegal livestreams\" must be blocked within three hours, the people said. Companies that do not meet the deadlines could see their platforms banned in the country, they added.\\nSocial media companies have also been told content that harms national security must be taken down immediately, according to two of the people and a third source. \\nCurrently, social media platforms often have a few days to handle requests from the Vietnamese government, the sources said.\\nThe amendments, which have not been made public, are expected to be signed by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh next month and enforced from July, five people said.\\nSources who spoke with Reuters for this article declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.\\nVietnam's foreign ministry said amendments to law concerning online information are being reviewed by the government.\\n\"Vietnam demands that businesses actively coordinate with the government in building a safe and healthy online environment, removing contents that are inappropriate or against legal regulations and national traditions of Vietnam,\" it said in an emailed statement.\\nRepresentatives for Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which owns YouTube and Google, declined to comment.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it had no immediate comment. \\nTikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will continue to comply with applicable local laws to ensure TikTok remains a safe space for creative expression, its Vietnam representative Nguyen Lam Thanh told Reuters, adding it would take down content that breaks platform guidelines.\\nMost governments do not have laws imposing the taking down of content on social media firms, but Vietnam's move comes amid intensifying crackdowns in some parts of the world on online content that have alarmed activists.\\nIndonesia's government is also preparing to impose a similar 24-hour time frame for government requests, sources have told Reuters.\\nIndia requires government requests to be met within 36 hours.\\nA MAJOR MARKET\\nVietnam, with a population of 98 million, is among Facebook's top 10 markets by user numbers with 60-70 million people on the platform, according to 2021 company data. \\nThe country generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for Facebook and is more profitable than many European markets, according to sources familiar with the matter.\\nYouTube has 60 million users in Vietnam and TikTok has 20 million, according to 2021 government estimates. Twitter is not as popular as most Vietnamese see it as an English forum.\\nBut the market poses ethical quandaries. Vietnam's Communist Party tolerates little criticism and the country's courts have handed out lengthy jail terms to dissidents and activists for posts critical of the government on Facebook and YouTube. \\nGovernment efforts to exert control over online content have only intensified. A cybersecurity law introduced in 2019 was followed up by national guidelines on social media behaviour in June last year. \\nIn 2020, Facebook agreed to significantly increase the censorship of \"anti-state\" posts for local users after Vietnamese authorities slowed traffic to its platform and threatened to shut it down entirely, company sources have previously told Reuters.\\nFacebook said at the time it had reluctantly complied with the government's request to \"restrict access to content which it has deemed to be illegal\".\\nHARD TO IMPLEMENT\\nThe planned changes stem from the government's dissatisfaction with current take-down rates for its requests, the sources said.\\nAccording to data from Vietnam's communications ministry, during the first quarter of 2022, Facebook complied with 90% of the government's take-down requests, Alphabet complied with 93% and TikTok complied with 73%.\\nThe sources said in addition to removing \"illegal\" content, the government wants social media firms to change algorithms to limit content concerning sexually suggestive material, gambling and the sale of unregulated medicines and supplements.\\nThe government is also keen to take down accounts of celebrities it believes are using their influence to sell unsuitable products, defame others and promote false charitable causes, they said.\\n\\nSocial media firms will have difficulty complying with take-down requests in 24 hours, the sources added.\\nThey noted that while obvious infractions of their own company rules like depictions of extreme violence can be handled very quickly, other requests take longer to assess and finding qualified staff is a challenge.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "60   FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank should end its stimulus programme in July and could raise interest rates that same month, in September or later, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos said in an interview published on Thursday.\\nThe ECB said last week that it would stop buying bonds in the third quarter of the year and raise interest rates some time after that, ending years of monetary largesse in the face of surprisingly high inflation.\\nDe Guindos was joining a growing number of ECB policymakers, including the Bundesbank's President Joachim Nagel, in calling for an early end to the Asset Purchase Programme.\\n\"My opinion is that the programme should end in July and for the first rate hike we will have to see our projections, the different scenarios and, only then, decide,\" de Guindos told Bloomberg.\\n\"From today’s perspective, (raising rates in) July is possible, and September or later is also possible,\" he added.\\nSpeaking to global policymakers in Washington on Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde also said future steps \"will depend on the incoming data and (the ECB's) evolving assessment of the outlook\".\\n\"In the current conditions of high uncertainty, we will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy,\" she told the International Monetary and Financial Committee.\\nBut Belgian central bank governor Pierre Wunsch, a policy hawk, was more outspoken, saying in a Bloomberg interview that raising the ECB's policy rate, currently at minus 0.5%, to zero or slightly above by year-end would be a \"no brainer\". \\nThe ECB will update its macro-economic projections in June and again in September.\\nThese estimates will be crucial because the ECB has said it would only raise rates when it is confident that inflation would stay at its 2% target over its forecast horizon.\\nInflation in the euro zone hit a record 7.5% last month and de Guindos hinted at it staying above the ECB's current projections for the rest of the year. \\n\"Inflation will start to decline in the second half of the year,\" he said. \"But even so, it will be above 4% in the final quarter.\"\\n\\nThe ECB said in March it saw inflation at 5.6% in the second quarter, 5.2% in the third quarter and 4.0% in the final three months.\\nFurther out, it saw inflation at 2.1% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.\\n \\n

       "61   By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- The euro surges as officials put a July rate hike back on the agenda. Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde both speak on the sidelines of the IMF meeting later. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) beats earnings expectations, but raises a few eyebrows in the process. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) forecasts good times ahead, but Equifax (NYSE:EFX) is downbeat about the outlook for the mortgage credit market. Russia declares 'victory' over a city where Ukrainian forces are still fighting, a day after it defaulted on a dollar bond payment due to the lack of cooperation from its U.S. bankers. AT&T (NYSE:T) results, jobless claims and the Philly Fed business survey are due. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 21st April.\\n1. Tesla’s earnings blow past expectations, raise eyebrows\\nTesla reported another stronger-than-expected quarter in the three months through March, with a net profit of $3.32 billion. That included a $679 million contribution from regulatory emissions credits, but an operating profit of $3.6 billion indicated solid underlying momentum in its core business.\\nCEO Elon Musk said the group should be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year, despite challenges from a three-week shutdown at Shanghai that only ended earlier this week.\\nSome cast doubt on the group’s accounting, suggesting that Tesla either wasn’t recognizing steep input price inflation or faced a big jump in costs in coming quarters. The company reported a 15% increase in operating expenditure, but an 80% rise in revenue. The disparity may lie partially in the company using up raw material inventories that were bought before prices for inputs such as battery metals went through the roof earlier this year.\\nTesla stock rose over 7% in premarket trading, more than reversing Wednesday’s declines.\\n2. ECB officials put July rate hike in play\\nThe euro rose to its highest in over a week after Vice President Luis de Guindos joined a chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of a rate increase in July. That would be the bank’s first in 12 years, and represents a significant shift after President Christine Lagarde soft-pedaled the outlook for tightening policy at her press conference last week.\\nLagarde and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell both speak on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting later, an event that has gathered the world’s central bankers at a time when inflation is running amok globally.\\nBy 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the euro was at $1.0915, up 0.6% on the day and just off its intraday high.\\n3. Stocks set to open higher; United soars, Equifax slumps\\nU.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, with Tesla’s well-received earnings helping to calm the fears stoked by Netflix’s results on Tuesday. \\nBy 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 208 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.1%. The Nasdaq had underperformed sharply on Wednesday, due to the heavy weighting of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which suffered its biggest one-day drop in 18 years. Netflix stock fell another 1.2% in premarket trading.\\nStocks likely to be in focus later include United Airlines, which reported upbeat guidance after the bell on Wednesday despite showing another big quarterly loss, and Equifax, which fell nearly 10% in after-hours trading after forecasting a sharp slowdown in mortgage credit inquiries over the rest of the year.\\nAT&T dominates the early reporters, along with Danaher (NYSE:DHR), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), while Swiss giant Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) already reported a thumping 7.6% rise in first-quarter sales, over 5% of which was due to price increases.\\n4. Jobless claims, Philly Fed survey due\\nThe number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits is expected to stay close to 60-year lows at 8:30 AM ET, a reflection of the continuing tightness of the U.S. labor market. Analysts expect initial claims to tick back down to 180,000 after last week’s increase to 185,000. Continuing claims are expected to grind lower to 1.455 million, a drop of 20,000.\\nThe numbers will be released at the same time as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s monthly manufacturing survey, which is expected to show a slight cooling of activity from February.\\nOf more interest than either may be the auction of inflation-protected 5-year Treasury notes at 1 PM ET. The last auction sold at an average yield of -1.508%. That’s unlikely to be repeated given the sharp rise in real bond yields in recent weeks.\\n5. Russia declares 'victory' in Mariupol\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin declared victory in the country’s battle for the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, even though elements of the defending forces continue to fight on. Putin told Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu in a choreographed video clip that Russian forces should rather conserve lives than storm the remaining Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steel mill.\\nPutin’s comments come a week after the loss of the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship Moskva. Moscow’s failure to account for a crew that it says was fully evacuated prior to the sinking has revived long-standing suspicions of the state’s disregard for its servicemen.\\nRussia was declared in potential default on Wednesday by an international committee overseeing credit derivatives. However, the failure to pay occurred because the western banks acting as payment agents refused to handle Russia’s dollars, rather than because Russia had chosen not to pay. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Russia's oil output fell to its lowest this year last week amid increasing practical problems in getting its product to willing buyers.  \n",

       "63   With even the most dovish U.S. central bankers now calling for a key interest rate to hit its \"neutral\" level by year's end to tame high inflation, the Federal Reserve appears headed for perhaps its swiftest shift in monetary policy since the 1960s, with all the risks that ride along with such an abrupt change.\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday is expected to further cement the case for an aggressive set of moves through year end, first in remarks to an inflation conference and later in an International Monetary Fund discussion.\\nSince their meeting in March, policymakers have grown uniformly more hawkish, led by Powell's insistence on a do-whatever-it-takes approach to contain inflation. Now joining him are policymakers like San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans who had been among the most persistent in arguing inflation could ease with less action by the Fed. \\n\"I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path,\" Daly said on Wednesday, referring to the interest rate level that officials see as neither fanning nor restricting the economy, a key but often difficult-to-estimate touchstone for policymaking.\\nThat remark placed her, like Evans, in support of raising the federal funds rate by half a percentage point at coming meetings rather than just a quarter point, a step that until recently was the province of more hard-core Fed inflation fighters.\\nIf officials follow through, they will have moved the federal funds rate from near zero to neutral in nine months after a first hike in March. Other tightening cycles have involved larger absolute increases in rates but came when estimates of neutral were higher, so policy remained \"accommodative\" for longer.\\nIn the cycle starting in mid-2004, for example, it took about two years to reach what a New York Fed model estimates the neutral rate was then, around 5.25%. It took a year, beginning in late 1993, to reach neutral during a cycle often cited as a possible parallel to this one by bringing inflation down without a recession.\\nA 'VOLCKER MOMENT'\\nOfficials hope that some of the current inflation fades on its own, letting them bring it back towards their 2% target without highly restrictive rates that would increase the risk of recession.\\nGiven the complexities of the moment, from the Ukraine war to the pandemic's continued impacts on global supply chains, achieving that is tough                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

But they were 234% higher compared with the same period last year.\\n\\nThe BoE is also keeping a close eye on the labour market as it worries about the risk that a shortage of candidates for jobs pushes up pay and creates a longer-term inflation problem.\\nTotal online job adverts increased by 4% in the week to April 14 April to 144% of their February 2020 average level, the ONS said, using data from jobs website Adzuna. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "69   Euro zone inflation in March was marginally lower than earlier reported, the EU's statistics office said on Thursday, but still at record highs because of a surge in the cost of energy.\\nThe European Union's statistics office Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.4% month-on-month in March for a 7.4% year-on-year increase.\\nAn earlier estimate by Eurostat put March inflation at 2.5% in the month and 7.5% from a year earlier.\\nEurostat said that out of the year-on-year total, 4.36 percentage points was due to surging energy prices while 1.12 points came from more expensive services and 1.07 points from food, alcohol and tobacco.\\nThe European Central Bank wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has signalled it would be tightening policy by ending its bond purchasing scheme later this year and moving towards a rate rise afterwards.\\n\\nEnergy prices were 44.4% higher than a year earlier in March, Eurostat said, while unprocessed food cost 7.8% more.\\nBut even when these two most volatile components were excluded from inflation measurements, annual inflation was 3.2% in March -- well above the

       "71   BOAO, China (Reuters) -A prolonged slowdown in China would have substantial global spillovers, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, but added that Beijing has room to adjust policy to provide support. \\nThe International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for China this year to 4.4%, well below Beijing's target of around 5.5%, on the risks of widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions.\\nIn a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia, Georgieva said China's actions to counter its economic slowdown are vital for the global recovery. \\n\"Fortunately, China has policy space to provide macroeconomic policy support, including shifting the focus toward vulnerable households to strengthen consumption, which can also help support China's climate goals by steering economic activity to lower-carbon sectors,\" Georgieva added. \\n\"Stronger policy efforts in the property sector can also help secure a balanced recovery.\"\\nAt the same venue, China's President Xi Jinping said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed.\\nIn light of growing headwinds, foreign brokerages have also been slashing GDP forecasts for China, after weakness in March activity data raised outlook risks as the lockdown in the mega city of Shanghai drags on.\\n Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Tuesday cut their already below-consensus forecast to 4.3%, from 4.5% previously, while BofA downgraded their forecast for this year to 4.2%, from 4.8% before. \\nNomura on Thursday revised their forecast to 3.9% this year, from 4.3% previously, and second-quarter growth is expected to expand by a meagre 1.8%, according to their baseline estimates. \\nBOOSTING CONSUMPTION\\n\"What we see in China is that consumption is falling short, it is not recovering as strongly as necessary,\" Georgieva told a news conference at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings on Wednesday. \"So rather than moving money into public investments, move it into the pockets of people, so there is more dynamism coming from a consumption boom.\" \\n\\nChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday it would roll out targeted measures to boost a recovery in consumption. Spending has been hit hard by lockdowns across the country that began last month to contain the spread of COVID-19.\\nFinal consumption accounted for 69.4% of China's GDP growth in the first quarter, according to official data.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "72   Japan's government upgraded its view of the economy for the first time in four months in April as authorities turned more optimistic about the outlook for private consumption following the end of COVID-19 curbs, the monthly economic report showed on Thursday.\\nHowever, private sector analysts have said the outlook is still clouded by challenges including a relentless surge in raw material and energy prices, which could further delay the recovery of the world's third-largest economy from the pandemic.\\n\"The economy appears to be picking up as the severe situation due to COVID-19 is easing,\" the government said in its April report, removing a reference to \"some weaknesses in recovery\" in the March issue.\\nThe overall upgrade was due mostly to a brighter assessment of private consumption, which also marked the first upgrade since December, as policymakers welcomed the lifting of months-long coronavirus curbs on face-to-face services by March 21.\\n\"Credit card spending data showed a pick-up in service consumption such as restaurants, travel and hotels towards late March,\" a government official told a media briefing before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet approved the report.\\nHowever, rising energy and food prices have dampened consumer sentiment, even as Japan enters an annual holiday week in early May.\\n\"The chance of a 'revenge spending' burst is becoming smaller than we had expected earlier,\" as lingering uncertainties around the Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 keep households cautious about spending, said the official.\\nThe yen's recent weakening to 20-year-lows has increased the inflationary pain for consumers and domestic-focused firms by swelling import costs.\\nIn the risk assessment section of the April report, the government listed \"financial and capital market volatilities\" among other downside risks to the economy, such as rising raw material prices and supply constraints, repeating the previous month's description.\\n\\nThe note was meant to include currency moves, the official said, although he added the government has not confirmed any data yet on the impact of the latest yen weakening on economic fundamentals.\\nThe government also raised its assessment of public investment for the first time since July 2020 on robust public works contract data. \\n \\n

       "74   By Leika Kihara\\nTOKYO (Reuters) -The yen's recent declines have been driven by fundamentals and would be no reason for Japan to change its economic policy, including the central bank's ultra-low interest rates, a senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official said.\\nThe remarks highlight the difficulty Tokyo may face if it sought international consent to intervene in the currency market to stem further yen falls, as G7 and G20 countries agree such action is justified only if exchange rates move out of line with fundamentals.\\n\"What we're seeing so far on the yen is driven by fundamentals,\" Sanjaya Panth, deputy director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, told Reuters late on Wednesday.\\n\"Economic policymaking should continue to look at fundamentals. We don't see any reason to change economic policy because what's happening right now reflects fundamentals.\"\\nThe yen has plunged to two-decade lows against the dollar, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continuing to defend its ultra-low rate policy in contrast with heightening chances of aggressive rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\\n\"We do not see disorderly market conditions right now in the foreign exchange market. It's been driven by fundamentals,\" Panth said, when asked whether yen-buying currency intervention by Japanese authorities would be justified.\\nMarkets are rife with speculation Japan may act to resist further yen declines, perhaps by buying yen, raising interest rates or tweaking the BOJ's dovish guidance on the future path of monetary policy.\\n\"As you know, a weak yen hasn't been bad for Japan,\" Panth said. \"At the same time, it does affect households. It's a little bit of a mixed bag,\" he said in the interview.\\nWith inflationary pressure still muted, there was no need for the BOJ to change its ultra-loose policy, Panth said.\\n\\nWhile temporary factors, such as the dissipating effect of past cuts in cellphone fees, could push up headline consumer price inflation, Japan was unlikely to see inflation sustainably reach the BOJ's 2% target in the near term, he added.\\n\"Japan is in a very different situation compared with other advanced countries who have begun tightening monetary policy,\" he said. \"We do not see any need to change the accommodative monetary policy stance.\"\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "76   The cost of a comprehensive car insurance policy in Britain touched an 18-month high in the first quarter and will continue to increase on the back of rising inflation and regulatory changes, a survey showed on Thursday.\\nUK motorists now have to pay about 550 pounds ($718.08) for a comprehensive car insurance premium, according to the latest index from price comparison site Confused.com in association with insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW).\\nCar insurance premiums had fallen for a year till the autumn of 2021 as lockdowns kept motorists off the roads and competition in the UK car insurance industry intensified.\\n\"As people return to more normal patterns of work and life, we are seeing those reductions in premiums gradually unwind,\" said Tim Rourke, UK Head of P&C Pricing, Product, Claims and Underwriting at WTW.\\nRourke also expects premiums to continue rising through 2022 as Britain battles high inflation and insurers face new rules by the Financial Conduct Authority that ensure consumers renewing policies are not charged more than new customers.\\nBritain's annual inflation rate climbed to 7% in March, its highest since 1992.\\n\"Prices could continue to increase simply because insurers are likely to be facing more claims than last year, as people start to drive more frequently, and this just means insurers will have to be as competitive as possible,\" said Louise O'Shea, CEO at Confused.com.\\n\"And in turn consumers will need to continue to shop around, as the assumption that renewal prices won't increase clearly isn't true.\"\\n\\nEighteen-year-old drivers continue to pay the most of any demographic, taking their average premiums to 1,419 pounds, the survey showed. \\n($1 = 0.7659 pounds) \\n \\n

       "77   Brazil's central bank said on Wednesday it would resume data release that were suspended due to a strike by its employees, including a weekly survey seen as critical for the monetary policy conduction. \\nThe central bank's weekly FOCUS survey compiles data from over 100 private economists for macroeconomic indicators, including inflation and interest rates. \\nIt was last released on March 28 and will be returned to normal next Tuesday, said the central bank. \\nCentral bank workers suspended the release of the survey and several other indicators in protest over wage demands. The strike, however, was paused on Tuesday, after the government signaled some disposition to grant salary adjustments.\\nIn charge of an aggressive monetary tightening to curb double-digit inflation, the Brazilian central bank has repeatedly said it will consider the convergence of market expectations to the official inflation targets in its policy dosage.\\n\\nMonitoring this data was seen as crucial at a time when consumer prices continue to surprise upwards, casting doubt on how far the tightening cycle would go. Rates stand at 11.75% from a 2% record low in March 2021, and policymakers had said one last hike of 100 basis points could wrap the process in May. \\nThe central bank said that it continued to have internal access to such information despite its interruption to the general public. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "78   Mexican inflation likely slowed very slightly during the first half of April, but remained well above the central bank's target, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, reinforcing bets the monetary authority will continue raising interest rates.\\nThe median forecast of 10 analysts surveyed was for inflation to reach 7.60%, marginally down from 7.62% in the second half of March.\\nCore inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, was seen climbing to 7.06%, its highest level since January 2001.\\nThe Bank of Mexico, which targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that, has increased the benchmark rate by 250 basis points in its last seven monetary policy meetings to 6.50%.\\nIts next decision is scheduled for May 12. \\nAnalysts have forecast the lending rate could end the year at 8%, according to the central bank's latest monthly poll.\\n\\nCompared to the previous two weeks, Mexican consumer prices are predicted to have risen by 0.07%, with core prices seen advancing 0.34%, the poll showed.\\nMexico's national statistics agency will publish consumer price index data for the first 15 days of April on

       "79   The U.S. dollar rose from a one-week low on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell all but confirmed a half a percentage-point tightening at the policy meeting next month, including consecutive rate increases this year.\\nThe dollar index, which gauges the strength of the currency versus a basket of rivals, gained 0.2% to 100.53, after trading lower for most of the session. The index has advanced 2.3% so far this month, on pace for its best monthly gain since June 2021.\\nPowell said a half-point interest rate increase will be \"on the table\" when the Fed meets on May 3-4 to approve the next in what is expected to be a series of rate increases this year.\\nFed funds futures have started to price in bets of three straight 50 basis-point hikes starting with next month's policy meeting, with an implied rate of about 2.71% in December. \\n\"Rising fears over an increasingly aggressive Fed policy posture weighed heavily on Treasuries, especially at the short end, and the pop in rates knocked Wall Street lower,\" Action Economics said in its blog after Powell's comments. \"However, the dollar was the beneficiary.\" \\nThe euro slid from a more than one-week high after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the ECB may need to cut its growth outlook further as the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine weighs on households and businesses.\\nLagarde's comments were in contrast to hawkish comments from ECB officials who seemed to suggest European Central Bank officials raised bets that euro zone interest rates will rise soon. \\nJoachim Nagel, president of Germany's Bundesbank, joined a chorus of policymakers in saying the ECB could raise interest rates at the start of the third quarter.. \\nMoney markets, which had eased rate hike bets following last Thursday's ECB meeting, were now pricing in a more than 20 basis-point (bps) rise by July and over nearly 80 bps of tightening by year-end.\\nThat would take benchmark interest rates above zero for the first time since 2013.\\nEuropean political news was also supportive, with French President Emmanuel Macron clearing a major hurdle ahead of Sunday's runoff election with a combative performance in a TV debate against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.\\nWith the deciding vote just four days away, some 59% of viewers found Macron to have been the most convincing in the debate, according to a snap poll for BFM TV, suggesting Macron's 10 percentage point lead in the polls was not under threat.\\nIn late trading, the euro fell 0.2% to $1.0832, after hitting $1.0936, its highest level since April 11. \\nThe dollar rose 0.3% against the yen to 128.30. \\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.5% to 0.9532

tightening.\\nAt 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% lower at 100.165, retreating from the more than two-year peak of 101.03 seen earlier in the week.\\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have pulled back from the highest level since December 2018 at close to 3%, helping the dollar to hand back some recent gains.\\nHowever, the buck remains particularly strong against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY up 0.1% to 128.05, off the two-decade high of 129.43 seen earlier in the week after the Bank of Japan once more stepped in to the bond market to defend its record low yield target.\\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday he had explained the yen's \"somewhat rapid\" declines to his Group of Seven counterparts and is due to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later this week. \\nIn a statement issued after their meeting, the leaders said they were closely monitoring global financial markets that have been \"volatile,\" creating a degree of nervousness about whether the G7 might move to combat the rapid moves.\\n“We had felt that FX intervention would not be seen until the 130 level and even now it is hard to describe market conditions as disorderly enough to justify intervention,” said analysts at ING, in a note.\\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later Thursday at the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington. \\nHis comments will be carefully studied with the Fed’s meeting in early May at the forefront of minds, amid expectations that the central bank will hike more aggressively than the quarter percentage point move it announced at its March meeting.\\nElsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.4% to 1.0890, as Vice President Luis de Guindos joined a growing chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of an interest rate hike as early as July with inflation running at record levels in the European Union.\\nThat said, the pair remains marginally above the 20-month low of 1.0757 with the war in Ukraine weighing along with the uncertainty surrounding the French political presidential election.\\nThere could be further weakness ahead as the euro is being used less often as a global payment currency, posting its biggest percentage-point drop in more than a decade in March, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT. \\nAUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7436, while USD/CNY rose 0.5% to 6.4501, climbing to its highest level since October 2021 amid concerns about a COVID-induced growth slowdown at the world’s second largest economy. \\nA prolonged slowdown in China would have substantial global spillovers, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, a couple of days after the organization cut its growth forecast for China this year to 4.4%, well below Beijing's target of around 5.5%.

       "81   By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- The euro rose in early trading in Europe on Thursday as Vice President Luis De Guindos joined a growing chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of an interest rate hike as early as July.\\nDe Guindos' comments follow similar ones from Deutsche Bundesbank head Joachim Nagel, and his Belgian and Latvian counterparts Pierre Wunsch and Martins Kazaks within the last 24 hours. All four are attending the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting.\\nThey represent a coordinated change in messaging from the bank after President Christine Lagarde had played down the chances of an early rate hike at her press conference only last week. While it's common for the German central bank to take a more hawkish line than the bank's official one, the comments have a greater weight coming from Lagarde's deputy.\\nBy 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the euro was up 0.4% at $1.0894, its highest in a week. It had hit a 20-month low of $1.0757 after Lagarde's press conference on Thursday.\\nNewswires quoted De Guindos as saying that there was \"no reason\" why the bank can't end its net asset purchases in July, which would pave the way for an interest rate hike almost immediately after. However, he stressed that any raising of rates would be \"data-dependent,\" given that the risks to the economic outlook have increased considerably with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week, the IMF had downgraded its growth forecast for the Eurozone this year to 2.8% from an earlier estimate of 3.9%. Inflation, meanwhile, is running at an all-time high for the single currency at 7.5%, although De Guindos said he expects it to moderate by the year-end.\\nOvernight, Belgian National Bank Governor Wunsch had told Bloomberg in an interview that a sequence of rate hikes this year was likely.\\n\"Without any really bad news coming from that front, hiking by the end of this year to zero or slightly positive territory for me would be a no brainer,” Wunsch said.\\nOn Wednesday, meanwhile, Bundesbank head Nagel had said “It seems we’ll be able to end net purchases, possibly already at the end of the second quarter,” paving the way for a first rate increase “at the beginning of the third quarter.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "84   Bearish bets on most Asian currencies firmed, a Reuters poll found on Thursday, as several regional central banks trail the U.S. Federal Reserve in tightening their monetary policies to fight red-hot inflation.\\nAnalysts turned short on the Chinese yuan for the first time since early-October due to worries of an economic slowdown in the country caused by COVID-19 lockdowns, the fortnightly poll of 14 respondents showed.\\n\"A combination of a lack of policy support and zero-COVID stance has weakened China's growth prospects and weighed on yuan sentiments,\" analysts at Maybank wrote in a note.\\nSoutheast Asian central banks have sought to balance lifting interest rates off historic lows — to tackle price pressures exacerbated by the Ukraine war — and supporting economic growth as the region emerges from a coronavirus-driven downturn.\\nMarket participants raised short positions on the Malaysian ringgit to their highest since late-August, while the position was the largest since early-December in case of the Thai baht.\\nThailand's central bank said last week it will focus monetary policy efforts on shoring up sluggish growth in Southeast Asia'a second-largest economy, as it continued to see inflationary pressures as transitory.\\nBearish bets were also raised on the Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and the Philippine peso. \\nThe dim view on emerging market currencies comes against the backdrop of a steady rise in the U.S. dollar amid expectations of more rate hikes from the Fed. The currency hit a two-year peak against a basket of currencies this week.\\n\"Asian currencies have generally faced pressure this month as U.S. yields have moved higher, helping propel the USD, and capital outflows from the region have accelerated,\" Mitul Kotecha, senior EM strategist at TD Securities said.  \\n\"It's hard to see any turnaround in Asian currencies unless U.S. yields take a decisive turn lower and in turn the USD reverses course more broadly.\"\\nBets on the Indonesian rupiah inched closer to a bearish territory after the country's central bank cut its 2022 economic growth outlook amid risks from inflation and geopolitical tensions.\\nMeanwhile, short positions on South Korea's won rose and long positions in the Singapore dollar were cut despite central banks in both countries recently tightening their monetary policy.\\nThe Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.\\nThe poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.\\nThe figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).\\nThe survey findings are provided below (positions in U.S. dollar versus each currency): \\nDATE USD/ USD USD USD USD/ USD US USD USD \\nCNY /KR /SG /ID TWD /IN D/ /PH /TH \\nW D R R MY P B \\nR \\n21-Apr--22 0.1 1.0 -0. -0. 0.94 0.7 0. 1 0.7 \\n7 17 03 5 89 1 \\n7-Apr-22 -0.4 0.9 -0. -0. 0.81 0.6 0. 0.5 0.3 \\n1 9 46 05 3 32 3 1 \\n24-Mar-22 -0.1 0.9 0.1 0.0 1.16 0.9 0. 1.4 0.4 \\n6 8 9 4 9 12 6 \\n9-Mar-22 -0.8 1.2 0.8 0.4 0.97 1.1 0. 0.8 -0. \\n5 2 9 05 9 08 \\n24-Feb-22 -0.9 0.3 -0. -0. 0.33 0.0 0. 0.1 -1. \\n9 9 77 01 7 2 9 07 \\n10-Feb-22 -0.9 0.8 -0. 0.4 -0.1 0.3 0. 0.7 -0. \\n9 5 98 6 8 2 1 4 31 \\n27-Jan-22 -1.2 0.8 -0. 0.1 -0.1 0.1 0. 0.8 0 \\n9 9 67 2 7 8 25 2 \\n13-Jan-22 -0.7 0.9 0.2 0.2 -0.1 -0. 0. 0.7 0.6 \\n3 7 2 5 29 28 1 1 \\n16-Dec-21 -1.0 0.5 0.6 0.5 0.09 1.0 0. 0.2 0.3 \\n7 3 7 4 7 84 6 \\n\\n2-Dec-21 -0.8 1.0 0.5 0.1 0 0.4 0. 0.2 0.7 \\n8 6 8 5 7 28 6 1 \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "86   By Luc Cohen\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -A decorated U.S. Air Force veteran who helped lead a fundraising campaign to build former President Donald Trump's promised wall along the U.S.-Mexican border pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiring to defraud donors.\\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan said Brian Kolfage told prospective donors he would \"not take a penny\" as he raised more than $25 million for the \"We Build the Wall\" campaign, yet took more than $350,000 and spent money on a boat, a luxury SUV, a golf cart, jewelry and cosmetic surgery.\\nKolfage, who also pleaded guilty to three tax charges, created the private campaign in December 2018, 14 years after losing his legs and right hand in a rocket attack in Iraq.\\nThe Miramar Beach, Florida, resident had led the fundraising push alongside former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was also charged in August 2020.\\nBannon's case was dismissed after Trump granted him a presidential pardon during the final hours of his presidency.\\nAt a remote hearing on Thursday, Kolfage said he told potential donors that their money would be used exclusively to build a wall, but instead kept a large sum for himself and concealed it from authorities to avoid paying taxes.\\n\"I knew what I was doing was wrong and a crime,\" Kolfage told U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres.\\nA co-defendant, Andrew Badolato, also pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy on Thursday. \\nKolfage could face 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 years in prison under recommended federal guidelines, while Badolato faces 41 to 51 months. Sentencings for both were scheduled for September.\\nThe final defendant, Timothy Shea, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer said this month that Shea would exercise \"his constitutional right to a fair trial.\"\\n\\nIn a separate case, Bannon was charged in November with two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena issued by a committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.\\nBannon has pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor counts.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "95   BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd cut its annual copper production outlook on Thursday as operations at its Escondida project in Chile were impacted by labour shortages due to rising COVID-19 cases, while road blockades associated with social unrest in the country blocked access to the mine.\\nChile, the world's top copper producer, earlier this month sued BHP, among other miners, over alleged environmental damages caused by its operations in the Atacama salt flats.\\nThe road blockades, threats of work stoppage over alleged worker contract breaches, and surging COVID-19 infections at Escondida affected production at the project, which houses the world's largest copper deposit.\\n\"Our Chilean assets experienced a challenging operating environment in the March 2022 quarter due to a reduction in our operational workforce as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Chile,\" the miner said in its third-quarter production report.\\nCopper production from Escondida is now expected between 1,000 thousand tonnes (kt) and 1,030 kt for 2022, down from its previous range of 1,020 kt to 1,080 kt, resulting in a slight downgrade to total copper output forecast to between 1,570 kt and 1,620 kt.\\n\\nThe miner has logged 1,112 kt of copper output so far this financial year, down 10% from last year. Its third-quarter iron ore output from Western Australia came in flat from a year ago, and missed consensus estimates.\\n(This story corrects headline and paragraph 1 to say the forecast cut was due to rising COVID-19 cases and road blockades in Chile.

       "99   Melvin Capital Management is planning to shrink to $5 billion from the $8.7 billion it managed at the end of March, aiming to become more nimble to seek better returns, said a source familiar with the matter. \\nMelvin, which lost nearly $7 billion early last year by betting on stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) would tumble, is targeting a size of between $4.5 billion-$5 billion and told investors that its maximum total assets under management should remain between $6.5 billion and $7 billion until June 2027, when this threshold could be changed, the source said.\\nTo remain within this limit, Melvin intends to return capital to investors every time it reaches $7 billion for more than 90 consecutive days, according to the source who did not want to be identified because the discussions are private. \\nGabe Plotkin, the founder of Melvin, had been betting since 2014 that GameStop shares would tumble as the world shifts away from the brick-and-mortar video retailer's offerings.\\nBut retail investors banded together to support GameStop, sending it surging more than 2,500% in January 2021. By the end of the month, Plotkin had closed the short position on the so-called meme stock, but the hedge fund lost 39% last year.\\n\\nMelvin intends to charge fees ranging from 15% to 25% under this new structure, down from its previous performance fee of 20% to 30%, the source said.\\nThe Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported earlier on the fund's restructuring. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "100  By Sheila Dang\\n(Reuters) -Snap Inc on Thursday forecast a rosy outlook for user growth on its Snapchat app, but said supply-chain disruptions and inflation could continue to hurt advertising demand.\\nShares of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) fell as much as 10% immediately after the results, but pared losses later on as investors digested the mixed results.\\nSnap forecast second-quarter daily active users at between 343 million and 345 million, above Wall Street estimates of 340 million.\\nHowever, the company warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure revenue.

       "108  By Mimosa Spencer\\nPARIS (Reuters) -Disruptions from COVID-19 lockdowns in China cast a cloud on forecast-beating first-quarter sales from Gucci owner  Kering  (EPA:PRTP) on Thursday, even as the group pointed to sustained demand from the United States and Western Europe for its high-end fashion and leather goods labels. \\nGroup sales for the three months ending in March came to 4.96 billion euros ($5.4 billion), up 21% and slightly above a consensus forecast of 4.69 billion euros cited by Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet.\\nKering SA's star label Gucci, which accounts for over half of the French luxury group's annual sales, clocked 13.4% growth, with a strong performance in the United States, Western Europe and Japan, while COVID lockdowns disrupted business in mainland China. \\nThis figure fell below Chauvet's estimate for 23% growth and marked a deceleration from last quarter. \\n\"The quarter is ahead of expectations overall by 5.6%,\" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein, noting that Gucci was \"one step behind\" consensus forecasts while flagging an \"impressive performance\" from smaller labels.\\nYves Saint Laurent posted 37.2% growth, while sales at Bottega Veneta grew 16.3%. After a few years of expanding Saint Laurent's store network, the group is shifting investments to other areas like communication and marketing, as well as expanding its product range. \\n“The fundamentals of the luxury market in China remain intact,” Kering Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists in a call, noting the resilience of Chinese consumers after crisis periods, the growing middle class and appetite in the country for luxury brands, echoing comments from other luxury groups including LVMH and Hermes, which both recently reported a strong start to the year.\\nThe executive cautioned, however, that the lockdowns were tougher than the intermittent disruptions last summer, and noted an impact on consumer sentiment in the country.\\nKering has been expanding Gucci's product range with an emphasis on the higher end and executives flagged good traction at higher price points.\\nStore closures in China, in March and April, however, adversely affected lower price points and slowed the label's ability to draw in new, younger clients, they said in a call with analysts. \\nCFO Duplaix said it was a bit early to comment on expectations for earnings at Gucci, noting \"a lot of moving parts,\" citing the lockdowns in China, where currently nearly a third of the group's store network is in cities affected by restrictions, and the war in Ukraine. \\n\\nHe also said it was too early to measure the impact of inflation on luxury demand and costs, noting there was room for price increases at some labels including Gucci, which raised some prices toward the end of the quarter in the low and mid-single-digit percentages.\\n($1 = 0.9232 euro)\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "109  (Reuters) -Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on Thursday he had no interest in making a bid for Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings Inc, days after the utility said it would evaluate a sale following interest from an unnamed potential buyer.\\nIn an open letter to Southwest's shareholders, Icahn said his \"only interest is to replace the incumbent board of directors\". \\nIf his slate of director nominees were elected, they would continue pursuing strategic alternatives for Southwest, Icahn said, but he would not consider bidding for the utility.\\nThe billionaire also questioned the acquisition interest from the anonymous potential buyer Southwest disclosed earlier this week, saying it was \"barely credible\".\\n\"When we state that we began this process because we received an indication of interest well in excess of Mr. Icahn's $82.50 per share offer, it is a fact,\" Southwest said in a statement on Thursday.\\nThe company also said it encourages Icahn to participate in the sale process.\\nIn October, Icahn sought to gain control of the Southwest Gas board and replace its chief executive officer after the company adopted a shareholder rights plan to stop his push to make it abandon a $2 billion takeover of Questar Pipelines.\\n\\nThe billionaire later launched a tender offer for Southwest shares, seeking to buy stock from other shareholders of the company at $82.50 each.

       "112  Peru's leftist President Pedro Castillo has signaled a tougher stance on protests against mining companies that are roiling the Andean nation, the world's second largest copper producer, mobilizing the army in a sharp tactical shift from a previous conciliatory approach.\\nMining activity has been halted at Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) Corp's Cuajone since late February as protesters from the mostly indigenous surrounding communities demand financial compensation and a share of future profits.\\nThe government on Wednesday announced a state of emergency at the Cuajone mine, saying it would send military forces and suspend the right to protest at the mine that has been shuttered for over 50 days.\\nThat's a significant pivot by Castillo, a former teacher who rode into office last year backed by voters in poor mining districts hoping for a greater share of Peru's mineral wealth. He has avoided clashing with protesters despite a series of blockades that have hit the country's main export sector.\\n\"The problem has to be solved now,\" Peru's Prime Minister Anibal Torres said on Wednesday, citing \"irrational\" community demands at Cuajone, including asking for $5 billion in payments. \"That has led us to declare a state of emergency.\"\\nMeanwhile, last week residents of the indigenous Fuerabamba community pitched tents just feet away from Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's huge Las Bambas open pit copper deposit.\\nThe protests have taken a combined 20% of Peru's copper production offline at a time when the Andean country is battling slower growth amid high global inflation.\\n\"Under this administration there are a greater number of mining protests and they are more serious,\" said Pablo O'Brien, a mining expert who worked as an adviser to several mining ministers, including under Castillo. \\n\"The protests last longer than they ever did and they have spread to regions where you didn't see social conflicts before.\"\\n'WE COULD STAY FOR YEARS'\\nProtests have also hit other mines in Peru since Castillo came to office last July, including the Anglo-Swiss Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s Antapaccay, and Canada-based Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) Inc's Constancia and Antamina mines, co-owned by Glencore and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP.\\nIn neighboring Chile, the No. 1 global copper producer, BHP is also facing road blockades that have disrupted operations at its major Escondida mine, forcing it to cut its annual copper production outlook this week. \\nBut the pinch has been felt harder in Peru, where Cuajone and Las Bambas put together add up to 1.5% of the country's gross domestic product. Shares of Southern Copper and MMG have plummeted over 5 and 8% respectively in the past week. \\nLas Bambas executives have called on the government to also declare a state of emergency at the mine.\\n\"Las Bambas currently is coordinating with the government, and we hope they can take the same action for Las Bambas,\" Wei Jianxian, MMG's Executive General Manager for the Americas, said in a call with analysts this week.\\nA government press representative said they were not aware of any plans for a state of emergency for Las Bambas. \\nProtesters, however, say they are digging in for the long-run, indicating that disruptions to the mining sector won't be easy to dismantle and that industry will continue to pressure the government to take firmer action.\\n\"We could stay here for years,\" Edison Vargas, 32, the president of the Fuerabamba community, told Reuters. Vargas and others have set up camp inside Las Bambas and say they are demanding the return of their ancestral lands.\\nThe mine had resettled some 400 Fuerabamba families over a decade ago in a compact urban town dubbed Nueva Fuerabamba to make way for the construction of Las Bambas, one of the world's top copper mines. It paid residents 600 million soles ($161 million) as compensation for the move, mine executives say.\\n\\nLas Bambas is notorious for mining conflicts and has faced over 450 days of road blockades since the mine opened in 2016. \\n\"If the government wants to turn their backs on us, we are ready,\" Vargas added. \"We prefer to die here in our old lands than back in Nueva Fuerabamba.\" \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "114  By Sam Boughedda\\nInvesting.com --  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) shares rose 1.8% on Thursday head of its earnings report on Friday, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $1.35 on revenue of $33.4 billion.\\nBofA Securities analyst David Barden reiterated a buy rating on the stock and $64 price target.\\nBarden told investors in a note that as Verizon begins to deploy additional C-band spectrum, they have taken into account the increase in interest expense. C-band is a spectrum range used in 5G for over-the-air waves.\\n\"This creates an incremental headwind for earnings, which is why we believe the company will also speak to FCF,\" added the analyst.\\nHe continued that they will be looking to quantify the impact of elevated marketing initiatives and discuss how much can be offset with differentiated revenue opportunities, including the expanded value segment, growth in fixed wireless access, and migrating subscribers to higher tier plans.\"

       "115  HOUSTON (Reuters) -Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Michael Hennigan said on Thursday he will continue leading the largest U.S. crude oil refiner while he undergoes treatment for throat cancer, according to a letter released by the company.\\n\"I will soon be undergoing a seven-week treatment protocol that includes a combination of radiation and chemotherapy,\" Hennigan said in the letter. \"This standard of care has been very successful in curing this type of cancer.\" \\nHennigan has been at the helm of Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon for two years, taking over from former Chief Executive Gary Hemminger, who spun off the independent refiner from  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) and built it into the nation's largest refiner through a series of acquisitions.\\nIn the letter to employees, Hennigan said the tumor \"was caught early and is curable. Tests have confirmed the cancer is limited to my throat and nearby lymph nodes.\"\\n\\nWhile continuing as chief executive, Hennigan said he plans to limit travel and speaking during treatment. \\nMarathon reported net income of $16.5 billion in 2021 rebounding from a $10.6 billion loss in 2020. Marathon operates 13 refineries with a combined crude oil refining capacity of 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd), equal to 16% of total U.S. processing, according the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

That helped to boost its overall earnings beyond what analysts had expected.\\n\"This will likely have the effect of making ongoing quarterly fee-related earnings somewhat higher, but also somewhat more volatile,\" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.\\nBlackstone has been mindful of the prospect of rising inflation and higher interest rates for years, which has informed its decision to concentrate its investments in hard assets such as warehouses, rental housing, enterprise software, and digital and energy infrastructure, President Jonathan Gray said during an analyst earnings call on Thursday.\\n\"We've been mindful of the prospect of rising interest rates and a normalization of market multiples for several years.

       "127  Chemicals maker Dow Inc on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit as stronger product prices and demand helped it overcome a surge in raw material costs.\\nLocal prices across Dow's three segments were up between 24% and 39% after the company boosted rates in an effort to combat supply-chain pressures, logistical snags and weather-related outages at plants. \\nShares of the company rose 5% to $70.94 in morning trade.\\nRising inflation and energy prices hitting multi-year peaks were expected to undercut the economic recovery that has lifted Dow's earnings in recent quarters.\\nBut Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said the company navigated the \"stubbornly high\" costs of crude oil and natural gas by taking advantage of abundant shale-based feedstocks.\\n\"Despite higher energy costs, we captured healthy end-market demand and achieved solid volume growth, price gains and margin expansion,\" Fitterling said.\\nTotal net sales rose to $15.26 billion from $11.88 billion a year ago.\\n\\nThe company, which makes chemicals used in a range of products including food packaging, mattresses, textiles and electronics, also said it took a $186 million hit to earnings in the quarter due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\\nExcluding items, Dow's earnings of $2.34 per share beat analysts' average estimate of $2.06, according

       "131  By Sam Boughedda\\nInvesting.com -- Online used car retailer  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) reported its first-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, missing analyst estimates. \\nThe company reported a loss per share of $2.89 on revenue of $3.5 billion.

They sold 105,185 retail units during the quarter, an increase of 14% YoY.\\nCarvana said its earnings and the used vehicle industry were impacted by Omicron, high used vehicle prices, rapid changes in interest rates, and other macro factors. They added that the factors affected retail units sold volume and were the primary driver of its results in Q1.\\n\"We view these macro factors as transitory and remain focused on delivering the best possible experiences to our customers,\" explained Ernie Garcia, founder and CEO of Carvana.\\nAfter opening lower, Carvana stock dropped to $83 in early Thursday trading.

       "132  Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali downgraded Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to Hold from Buy with a $50.00 per share price target.\\nSquali notes that Twitter stock price is close to his price target as the company awaits a reported hostile tender offer from Elon Musk.\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO’s $54.20 per share offer is seen as “fair” while Squali says that “a competing bid is unlikely given 1) how restricted the “strategics” like GOOGL/MSFT are in M&A, 2) size of investment (at $43B+), and 3) valuation.”\\nThe analyst added that Twitter stock price could “revert to the low-to-mid $30s” if Musk’s offer fails to materialize. A move to $30 would see shares tumble roughly 35% from current levels.\\nMoreover, the analyst expects Twitter to report in-line Q1 results.\\n“We note however that both F/X and the Russia/Ukraine war are short-term headwinds.. 1Q22 is a tough comp period with the company lapping 1Q21’s 28% growth. Given Twitter’s heavier skew towards brand advertising, we see the company as somewhat insulated from Apple’s iOS14.5 changes on measurement and targeting,” Squali wrote in a client note.\\nTwitter stock is down nearly 1% today.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "135  By Sam Boughedda\\nInvesting.com -- Xerox Corp. (NASDAQ:XRX) reported its first quarter earnings before the bell Thursday, sending its stock tumbling more than 18.5%.\\nThe company, which sells print and digital document products and services, reported a loss per share of 12 cents on revenue of $1.67 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected earnings per share of 29 cents on revenue of $1.65 billion.\\nThe company blamed broad-based inflationary pressure and increased logistics costs from supply chain disruption for its operating loss. However, it expects to offset most of these cost increases with price actions, and additional \"Project Own It\" savings.\\n“Revenue was in line with expectations this quarter despite an increasingly volatile operating environment,” said Xerox Vice Chairman and CEO John Visentin.\\nXerox maintained its 2022 revenue guidance of \"at least $7.1 billion.\" However, it warned that the guidance assumes supply chain disruptions will subside and return to office trends will continue to improve in the second half of the year.

       "142  Stellantis' Citroen announced on Thursday the end of its C4 Grand SpaceTourer model, drawing a line under 30 years of minivans that embodied the brand's family image now overshadowed by SUVs.\\n\"Because customers' aspirations have evolved, expression of modernity and enhancement is today carried by other shapes (and) the way of thinking mobility is changing, C4 Grand SpaceTourer is now bowing out\", the brand said in a statement.\\nIn France, minivan sales fell almost to zero in the first quarter as SUVs claimed the lion's share at 46% of new car registrations, racing with traditional sedans which bring in 47% of sales.\\nProduction of the C4 Grand SpaceTourer at the plant located in Vigo, Spain, will stop at the beginning of July after current orders are delivered, Stellantis added in a press release.\\n\\nCitroen, which retains two models of electric minivans in its catalog, plans to focus on its C5 Aircross SUV and its large C5X sedan.\\nIn 30 years, the brand sold nearly 4.5 million minivans worldwide, fuelled by the Evasion from 1994, the C8 from 2002 and, most importantly, the Xsara and C4 Picasso after 1998, whose rounded silhouettes and family-friendly designs found favour with customers. \\n \\n

       "144  Upside Foods has raised $400 million in a funding round led by Temasek and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, valuing the cultivated meat company at over $1 billion, the company said on Thursday.\\nSoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Synthesis Capital are among the investors who took part in the latest round, bringing the company's total capital raised to $608 million. \\nWhile brands like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc and Impossible Foods have cashed in on a boom in plant-based sources of protein, Upside produces lab-grown meat from animal cells eliminating the need to slaughter animals.\\nUpside has also drawn investor interest from companies including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Whole Foods, as the food industry sees the need for innovative and alternative meats to appease a strong shift in consumer choices. \\nThere are people who want to have the taste of meat but cannot agree with the continuous destruction and environmental impact of conventional meat production, said Dr Uma Valeti, chief executive officer of Upside Foods, adding that that's where cultivated meat will come in.\\nPreviously known as Memphis Meats, the seven-year-old company plans to use the funds to build a commercial facility to produce its cultivated meat products and also invest in research and development. \\n\"We picked chicken as the product we want to go to market with followed by beef and seafood,\" said Dr Valeti.\\n\\nThe company said its product will be available to U.S. consumers later this year, pending regulatory review. \\nThe California-based company, which counts Bill Gates, Richard Branson and food giant Cargill among its investors, had in January acquired

       "147   Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) shares are down more than 6% in premarket trading Thursday following the company’s worse-than-expected Q1 sales report.\\nAlcoa generated $3.29 billion in sales in the first quarter, up 15% YoY but below the consensus estimates of $3.44 billion. The company reported adjusted EPS of $3.06, up from 79c in the same period last year and beating the consensus projection of $2.84 per share.\\nAdjusted EBITDA stood at $1.07 billion in the period, up from $521 in the year-ago period and compared to the analyst expectations of $1.04 billion.\\nAluminum production totaled 498,000 mt, down 9.1% YoY and below estimates of 526,533.\\nWolfe Research analyst Timna Tanners reiterated an Outperform rating and lowered the price target to $102.00 per share (from $105.00) after “light Q1 volumes.” The analyst is still bullish on this commodity stock and sees a buying opportunity amidst an after-hours selloff.\\n“We would be buyers of any weakness after Q1 results, even as we trim 2022E EBITDA to $4.2B from $4.7B and EPS to $12.25 from $12.80 on lower alumina forecasts and assuming some cost pressure. Aluminum prices look well supported by limited new supply and elevated global costs, and we see structural demand resilience from favorable packaging and light-weighting trends. Investors seem keen to own miners for a hedge against inflation, and this sector rotation can support valuation, in our view,” Tanners said in a client note.\\nBMO analyst David Gagliano lowered the price target to $95.00 per share from $99.00 to reflect incremental cost pressures and lower expected bauxite results.\\n“Bigger Picture: AA remains well positioned to benefit from higher-for-longer aluminum prices, in our view. But, the rally in AA shares has brought valuations to reasonable levels… hence maintaining the Market Perform,” the analyst wrote.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "148  Hedge fund Melvin Capital is considering a new plan that would see the fund return the capital to its investors, allowing them to reinvest it in a novel fund which would also be run by Gabe Plotkin, according to CNBC.\\nPlotkin, founder and CEO of Melvin Capital, is looking to unwind the current fund by the end of June to start a new one on July 1 using the capital the fund’s investors decide to reinvest. If the plan moves forward, Plotkin would achieve this without having to bring Melvin investors back to even on their invested money before he could make a performance profit.\\nThis is because it would be extremely difficult for Plotkin to bring investors back even after the fund sustained a 39% loss in 2021 and an additional 21% loss this year.\\nPlotkin plans to keep the new fund at or below $5 billion in capital and focus on shorting stocks once again, a strategy that yielded him substantial returns over the past years before taking a heavy blow amid the meme stock craze in January 2021.\\nThe move would give Plotkin and Melvin Capital a second chance after a year and a half of disappointing performance, as well as enable him to retain his employees who were likely to leave due to lack of performance fees.\\nThe impact of the new plan remains unclear as well as how much capital would Melvin investors reinvest in the new fund.\\nBy Senad Karaahmetovic

       "151  Poland's biggest fashion retailer LPP faces a surplus of merchandise this year after closing stores in Eastern Europe, which is likely to erode its profits in the first half and squeeze profit margins in 2022, Chief Financial Officer Przemyslaw Lutkiewicz told a news briefing on Thursday.\\n\"We were preparing for a completely different year, counting on operations on Eastern markets and that our sales would exceed 20 billion zlotys ($4.70 billion)\", Lutkiewicz said. \"This surplus is due to the fact that we do not have sales on the eastern markets.\" \\nInstead, the company now expects revenue in its year through Jan. 31, 2023, of 16 billion zlotys, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February compelled it to close its stores in both those countries. \\nLutkiewicz said excess inventory would make for a challenging first half. The company will sell its spring stock in the autumn and sell the rest to Poland and the \"countries where we are currently operating\", he said.\\nFor the second half of the year, the company has slashed its merchandise orders by 25-30% to account for fewer stores after the closures. \\nThe company said, however, that it saw no supply chain issues despite pandemic-related restrictions in China.\\nLPP expects a decrease in operating margin in 2022, and plans capital expenditure during the year of 1 billion zlotys, compared to 1.33 billion zlotys a year earlier. \\nThe company plans to expand its presence in the European Union in 2022.\\nLPP said the first quarter looked good despite difficulties related to the war in Ukraine.\\nLutkiewicz said the company saw \"good sales in March and April. 30-40% increase in sales year on year.\"\\n\\nFor the year through Jan. 31, the company earned a net profit of 953.5 million zlotys on revenue of 14.03 billion zlotys.\\n($1 = 4.2549 zlotys) \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "152  MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) has started talks with banks to raise around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in financing that could be partly guaranteed by Italy's export insurer SACE, three sources familiar with the matter said. \\nBurdened with total gross debt of more than 30 billion euros, TIM has around 3 billion euro in bonds coming due this year, the annual report shows. \\nTIM is talking to UniCredit, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Santander (BME:SAN) over a deal to secure a credit line, the sources said. The banks involved had no comment. \\nUnder a guarantee scheme Italy used during the first COVID-19 wave in 2020 to help companies raise new debt, SACE is allowed to cover up to 80% of the financing.\\nHowever, there are doubts as to whether TIM is eligible to tap such a scheme, one of the sources said.\\n\"A new credit line of this amount, possibly backed by SACE, therefore structured with more favorable terms, should be positive ... as it would help  Telecom Italia  (BIT:TLIT) boost its reserves and more easily meet some of the extraordinary payments expected during the current year,\" Bestinver said in a report.\\nTIM faces a 1.7 billion euro payment by the end of September as part of the amount it put in the pot to secure frequencies in a fifth-generation mobile spectrum

       "153  (Reuters) -The head of luxury house LVMH, Bernard Arnault, said on Thursday that the company's outlook this year was \"so far so good\".\\n\"You saw the first quarter figures, what I can say is that the beginning of April was pretty much in the same vein,\" he told journalists on the sidelines of his empire's annual shareholder meeting.\\nLVMH last week posted a forecast beating 23% rise in first quarter like-for-like sales, with growth driven by fashion and leather goods, its largest division and home to Louis Vuitton and Dior, among other labels.\\nLooking further ahead, the performance of the group, which spans high end Bulgari hotels to Hennessy cognac, would depend on \"a number of things\", he added, citing COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the geopolitical situation in Europe.\\n\\nArnault also said it was too soon to tell whether rising inflation was hitting luxury consumer behaviour. \\nAsked about the situation in China, he said \"the demand is there\" but the outlook would depend on how long strict measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the country would last.\\n \\n

       "156  Generali (BIT:GASI) boss Philippe Donnet, facing a challenge to his leadership from rebel investors, is confident he can deliver on his plans for the Italian insurer and says he is not concerned about the outcome of what some investors see as a \"soap opera\".\\nShareholders in Europe's third-largest insurer vote next Friday (April 29) on a proposal by Generali's board to hand Donnet, 61, a third term at the helm. \\nBut his reappointment has been called into question by a shareholder battle pitting Italian billionaires Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio against the insurer's main investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).\\nCaltagirone, 79, and Del Vecchio, 86, are Generali's second- and third-largest shareholders, respectively.\\n\"I'm not concerned because this is not about my role,\" Donnet told Reuters in an interview in Milan. \\n\"It's about two very different visions of what Generali's governance should look like,\" citing the company's way of doing things as an example of best practice.\\nCaltagirone has proposed as CEO Luciano Cirina, who ran Generali's Austria and CEE business until March, and pledged to grow Generali's earnings per share almost twice as fast compared with the strategy through 2024 the group unveiled in December.\\n\"Investors knew and liked our plan and they've given us their backing. They ... appreciate that the plan is ambitious, credible and realistic,\" Donnet said after meeting shareholders in London, New York and Boston. \\nHaving successfully steered Generali through the pandemic during his six years at the helm, Donnet said Generali would meet its financial goals despite the Ukraine war.\\n\"I'm very confident we'll hit the plan's targets despite the current geopolitical difficulties,\" he said.\\nAsked about Generali's Russian business, Donnet said the insurer was working to wind down, as announced, its Europ Assistance operations in the country, where its sole customer is Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), while it would keep its stake in local insurer Ingosstrakh frozen. \\n\"It's not a good time to sell, we don't want to enter negotiations with Russian counterparts.\"\\n'RATIONAL BEINGS'\\nDonnet said institutional investors, who hold roughly a third of Generali's capital, struggled to understand the reasons behind what they saw as an Italian \"soap opera\".\\n\"Investors are rational beings and they're very perplexed by what is happening,\" said Donnet, who holds dual Italian and French nationality. \"And I also have trouble explaining it because I'm also a rational being.\"\\nBlaming Donnet for what they see as an overly timid acquisition strategy, the rebel investors say Generali has fallen behind rival AXA and Allianz (ETR:ALVG) in terms of market value, though Italy's top insurer has generated the sector's highest total shareholder return since 2016.\\nGenerali has earmarked 3 billion euros for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), less than half the 7 billion euros indicated by the challengers. \\nDonnet said the M&A budget was \"enough to clinch good transactions\", adding that while \"the pipeline of M&A opportunities is never empty ... good deals mature slowly\".\\nHe pointed to the recently concluded acquisition of French healthcare professional insurer La Medicale, which had required six years of bilateral negotiations. \\n\\nGenerali would not shy away if \"the dream acquisition\" came along and would turn to investors to raise capital if it had to spend more than the allotted 3 billion euros.\\n\"We are well-placed to tap the market for cash. I am confident we could do it because we've earned trust of our investors,\" he said. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "162  By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- U.S. airline stocks took flight in premarket on Thursday as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) joined rival United in giving a strong outlook for the spring and summer quarters. \\nBy 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), American Airlines stock was up 10.6% at its highest in six months, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was up 8.5% at its highest since February. Delta  (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest  (NYSE:LUV) stock were both up more than 3%, while JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock was up 4.9%.\\nAmerican said it will return to profitability in the current quarter, flying at between 92%-94% of its pre-pandemic capacity levels. It sees revenue being between 6%-8% above the comparable quarter in 2019, \"based on current trends\".\\nIt already posted a record sales figure for March, which drove first-quarter revenue to $8.9 billion, some 3% ahead of consensus forecasts. The airline's adjusted net loss of $2.32 a share was also slightly better than a consensus forecast of $2.44, and was barely half of the $4.32 loss a year earlier. \\nUnited, meanwhile, had said late on Wednesday that it expects to be profitable this year, thanks to the return of business travel for the first time since collapsing two years ago at the start of the pandemic.\\nAirline stocks already received a boost at the start of the week when a Federal judge threw out the mask mandate that the Biden administration had sought to impose on flights as part of its Covid-19 health measures. Restrictions both in the U.S. and across most of the world have been relaxed in recent months as successive new dominant strains of the disease have mutated into something less virulent and aggressive than its early strains. \\n\"Demand for domestic business travel has steadily improved as offices have reopened and travel restrictions have been lifted,\" American said. \"Revenue from small- to medium-size businesses and customers traveling for a mix of business and leisure remains very strong and is approaching a full recovery, and corporate bookings are the highest they have been since the start of the pandemic.\"\\nIt also noted that demand for international travel has also picked up considerably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "164  Mexico's cash-strapped state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is under pressure to resume financial debt repayments despite promises from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that his government would pay them until 2024. On Thursday, Pemex is due to pay some 1 billion euros to redeem a 2015 bond, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \"Pemex will make payment of its maturities this month with its own resources, since the finance ministry did not make capital contributions to the company in April (for that),\" said one of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous.\\nNeither the finance ministry nor Pemex responded to requests for comment.\\nPemex, one of the world's most-indebted oil companies, has struggled with years of declining crude production and in 2020 lost its coveted investment-grade debt rating.\\nThe source said between May and December Pemex faces outstanding principal and interest payments, mainly related to bonds, worth some $3.8 billion. \"The finance ministry notified Pemex about three weeks ago the company had to pay the eurobond, arguing it has more funds due to the increase in ... oil prices,\" the source added.\\nPemex has said it must shoulder peso-denominated financial debt maturities in 2022 worth some $8.4 billion, and another $15.2 billion of debt commitments in other currencies. The ministry has in recent weeks also pressed Pemex to resume amortizations linked mainly to debt issuances, which this year amount to some $7.5 billion, another $7.4 billion in 2023 and $8.8 billion in 2024, the source said.\\nIn 2021, debt amortizations totaled about $6.4 billion.\\nThe second source told Reuters \"the additional income from Pemex will be significant, and that allows the company to receive less (government) support\", without giving details on how much extra income was expected due to the increase in crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nPemex's financial debt closed 2021 at $109.0 billion. Net losses were $10.9 billion last year.\\nPemex has begun drawing up a refinancing plan for some $3.5 billion in financial debt, anticipating the funds will not come from the government for now, the first source said.\\nMexico in January swapped short-term Pemex bonds for a new 10-year bond as part of a scheme to lower debt and reduce medium-term financial pressure on the firm.\\nMexico's government in 2021 made capital contributions to Pemex of 202.569 billion pesos for debt repayments and granted the firm 73.280 billion pesos in tax incentives.\\nPemex officials recently said the government will provide it with capital this year in accordance with its maturity profile.\\n\\nLast month, Lopez Obrador said Mexico will reduce refining output at Pemex while it modernizes its refineries, as the government capitalizes on high oil prices.\\nMexico has said it will use extra revenue collected from oil prices to subsidize domestic gasoline and diesel prices, helping to contain inflation. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "174  Hedge fund manager William Bill Ackman sold his entire stake in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), a move that resulted in a $400 million loss after the streaming service provider’s shares tumbled due to a decline in subscribers.\\nAckman, founder and CEO of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, offloaded 3.1 million Netflix shares it acquired three months ago.\\nEarlier this week, Netflix reported a drop in the number of global paid subscribers for the first time in ten years, sending the company’s shares declining by 35% to $226.19 per share.\\nAckman invested $1.1 billion in Netflix in January shortly after its shares fell due to a weaker-than-expected subscription forecast. In its earnings report this week, Netflix reported a decline of 200,000 in the number of paid subscribers, urging the billionaire investor to make a U-turn and sell his stake.\\nAckman said that Netflix’s potential business model changes such as focusing on non-paying customers and advertising seemed reasonable, however, it would make the streaming giant very unpredictable in the short run.\\n\"While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,\" Ackman said in a statement.\\nHe said that his hedge fund, which has a limited portfolio of just a dozen of companies, prefers to invest in companies that are highly

       "175  Soaring demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as buyers steer clear of Russian fuel is putting some long-stalled U.S. export projects back on track. But rising costs for materials and labor threaten to snarl these plants once again.\\nTwo developers with projects sidelined due to the U.S.-China trade war –  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) with its Lake Charles LNG and Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc with its Driftwood LNG – have begun talks with construction provider Bechtel Group over costs, according to a spokesperson and regulatory filing. \\nMaterials prices have shot up 20% in the past two years while gas compressors are 30% costlier, construction and energy experts said. Metals required for LNG projects are in short supply due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and could add another 10% to costs, they added. \\nHigher costs mean lower returns and could give an edge to rivals with newer, modular designs that rely on off-the-shelf components and, in one case, speedier construction using oil platforms for production sites. Costs of U.S. natural gas hit a 13-year high this month, adding to financial hurdles.\\n\"Who knows what LNG terminals are going to cost now,\" warned Michael Smith, CEO of Freeport LNG, a Texas firm that started commercial production in 2019 after a four-year construction period. \\nA large portion of construction material costs are steel and nickel alloy piping, Smith said at last month's CERAWeek energy conference. \"Fifty percent of nickel comes from Russia.\" \\nSOARING MATERIALS COST\\nSteel used to assemble LNG storage tanks is up about 10% this year and nickel, required to make steel and nickel alloys for piping, has gained 40% since February, according to Black & Veatch, which designs and builds LNG terminals. \\nRebar, steel used to strengthen concrete, cost more than $1,100 per short tonne on April 8, up 10% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and up 40% from a year earlier, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Commodity Insights' Platts assessments show. [IRONORE/]\\nRising costs to build a new U.S. LNG export facility makes it \"more expensive for a developer to move forward,\" said Kenneth Medlock III, a fellow in Energy and Resource Economics at Baker Institute for Public Policy. \\nLNG plants built a few years ago cost about $540 per tonne of annual LNG output, putting the construction of a 10 million tonne per annum plant at $5.4 billion, said Greg Vesey, former CEO of LNG Ltd, which sold its proposed export project in 2020. \\n\"At a 25% increase, the range is going to be between $600 and $700 a tonne,\" Vesey added. \\nREVISITING DESIGNS\\nThe cost hikes are, however, not likely to halt new construction. Wall Street analysts now expect four multi-billion-dollar plants to be approved this year, versus a previous projection of two or three plants. \\nU.S. LNG exports in March rose to a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), versus an average 9.7 bcfd for calendar 2021, according to U.S. government data. \\nBut soaring raw materials prices may lead to a revision in contracts and financing needs, weakening potential returns.\\nLake Charles LNG's 2015 regulatory filing estimated construction goods and services would cost $1.68 billion and wages would be $2.72 billion. \\nThe Energy Transfer's Lake Charles, Louisiana, project would need \"an updated cost assessment,\" investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said last month. \\nEnergy Transfer did not reply to requests for comment.\\nHowever, it told U.S. energy regulators on March 7 it was working with the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider Bechtel that will \"enable EPC pricing updates\" this summer. It did not offer an estimated cost increase. \\nTellurian added $300 million to its original $15.2 billion EPC contract with Bechtel for Driftwood LNG, spokesperson Joi Lecznar said. She did not say when the increase went into effect or if another is pending. \\nBechtel declined to comment. \\nLIKE LEGO\\nTo cut costs, newer plant developers including New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) are employing modular liquefaction units made by Baker Hughes Inc that are prebuilt in factories and can be snapped together like Legos. \\nNew Fortress claims it could put together a plant atop an offshore drilling rig in 12 months. \\n\"Using modular units has the potential to offer savings in both time and money compared with building a complex large-scale project from scratch,\" said Robert Songer, LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS. \\nSean Morgan, a director at investment bank Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) ISI, pointed out that the designs allow for \"lower upfront capital expenditure commitments by capital providers and the project builders.\" \\nLNG developer Venture Global is installing 18 modular units at its Calcasieu Pass project in Louisiana. The project's $580 per tonne cost is about 26% cheaper than early LNG export terminals, according Ross Wyeno, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\\n\\nSuch designs slash on-site construction labor costs, said Paul Varello, chairman of Commonwealth LNG, which is targeting a 2023 financial decision for its proposed U.S. Gulf Coast plant. \\n\"One benefit is their tendency to not be as sensitive to inflationary impacts,\" he said. \"By having that savings, we're able to be competitive on our prices.\" \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "183  By Geoffrey Smith \\nInvesting.com -- THG (LON:THG) shares rose 5.5% in London on speculation that the Direct-to-Consumer specialist could be bought, after CEO Matt Moulding said it had received tentative approaches from possible buyers in recent weeks. \\n\"You will all be aware that there has been significant speculation about possible third party interest in THG,\" Moulding said in a press release accompanying THG's preliminary first-quarter results. \"I can confirm that the Board has received indicative proposals from numerous parties in recent weeks. The Board has concluded that each and every proposal to date has been unacceptable, failing to reflect the fair value of the Group, and confirms that THG is not currently in receipt of any approaches.\"\\nMoulding, whose performance has come under criticism due to the poor performance of the group's stock since it listed in London 19 months ago, added that he would continue executing the group's existing strategy.\\nBy 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), THG stock in London was up 7.5% at a seven-week high. It's still lost around five-sixths of its value since listing.\\nTHG's quarterly figures were slightly better than expected, and the company upheld its prior guidance for an increase of between 22%-25% in currency-adjusted revenue this year. Revenue was up 17% on the year, with the beauty segment growing 19.7% and the nutrition segment growing 12.6%. The number of websites powered by the group's technology rose to 202 from 187 at the end of the fourth quarter.\\nIt warned though that its margins may come under pressure as it tries to absorb at least some of the cost pressure currently affecting it. The company said it will aim to raise prices \"at a lower rate to underlying input costs.\"  \\n\"We believe the recent and rapid inflationary environment is largely transitory, and THG will, as far as possible, continue to shield consumers from these adverse macro-economic conditions,\" Moulding said, going against the recent trend of increasingly alarmist rhetoric about inflation from companies across the spectrum. Moulding noted the importance of retaining customers, saying that 78% of its revenue comes from repeat business. Most of that comes from high-frequency purchases in the beauty and nutrition segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "185  (Bloomberg) -- Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) reported a healthy gain in revenue as the world’s largest food company started the year with its strongest first-quarter pricing in more than a decade. \\nSales rose 7.6% on an organic basis in the first quarter, the company said Thursday. Analysts expected 5.1%. The figures exclude Russia, where Nestle has halted some activities.\\nFood and beverage companies have been raising prices amid strong demand as consumers return to offices and eat outside of home more often. The sector has benefited from resilient appetite for basic necessities while European industrial companies and carmakers suffer from higher costs and supply-chain bottlenecks.\\nRead more: War Hits Europe Car Sales Recovery, Undermines Manufacturers\\nNestle shares gained as much as 1.9% in early trading. \\nRival Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) reported its fastest quarterly sales growth in seven years Wednesday, while Heineken (OTC:HEINY) NV’s unusually big price increases helped revenue increase by 36% in the period. While the ability to raise prices on consumers may blunt the impact of higher raw material costs, the risk is that it may eventually drive some shoppers to cheaper alternatives. \\n“We are getting used to companies beating consensus sales growth expectations this quarter -- L’Oreal, Danone and Heineken have all done it -- but in our view Nestle is the most impressive yet,” James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC, wrote. He said that the company’s shipment growth is admirable in the context of such strong pricing.\\nThe war in Ukraine has exacerbated food inflation because the country is a major supplier of wheat and sunflower oil. Meanwhile inflation in prices for coffee, plastic and shipping are cutting into profitability at the maker of KitKat chocolate and San Pellegrino water. \\n“Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said in a statement.\\nSchneider had faced criticism for continuing to do business in Russia, with Ukrainian politicians even calling him out by name and demanding a full exit. Nestle eventually suspended the vast majority of its production in the country, but Schneider maintains that access to food is a basic right.

However, by the end of that period restrictions had eased, and it exited March with a like-for-like sales growth rate of 19.4%.\\nPepco said this demonstrated \"the strong underlying customer demand for the group’s offer, supporting our confidence for the second half\".\\nThe group, which does not trade online bar a small Poundland trial, forecast first-half core earnings (EBITDA) within a range of 342 million euros to 350 million euros.\\n\"Within this range, the group remains on track to meet guidance for the full year in the absence of any further significant deterioration in the macro environment,\" it said.\\nShares in Pepco, priced at 40 zlotys at the IPO, were trading at about 44.5 zlotys.\\n\\nMasters succeeded Andy Bond, who stepped down for health reasons at the end of March.\\n($1 = 0.9182 euros)\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

But China's stringent lockdown measures could impact the completion of new hotels, he said.\\nTravel in Asia-Pacific is trailing the rest of the world and should expect a bumpy recovery, because of slower border reopenings, a Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com executive said in March.\\n\\nAt the end of the company's expansion programme, Asia-Pacific will account for most of Radisson's hotel rooms though much of revenues will still come from Europe.\\nRevenues and profits are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by next year, Gonzalez said, as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted around the world. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "199  Hyundai Motor Co is likely to report a 4% bump in first-quarter profit thanks to a sharply weaker won boosting the value of its exports and offsetting a prolonged chip shortage, a sales slump in Russia and rising raw material costs.\\nFor the quarter ended March 31, the South Korean automaker is expected to report a net profit of 1.37 trillion won ($1.11 billion), according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate drawn from 14 analysts, up from 1.32 trillion won a year earlier.\\nBut analysts said the ongoing global chip shortage remains a major problem for Hyundai, which when grouped with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 automakers by sales.\\nHyundai's production could be further squeezed by shortages of other parts, those that it buys from China, where many factories have shut due to COVID-19 lockdowns, they said.\\n\"A weak won was a key booster for Hyundai,\" said Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment Securities.\\n\"The speed of won depreciation has been drastic enough to offset all the problems, including chip shortages, a spike in raw material prices and poor sales in Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\"\\nThe South Korean won was

Ten-year yields continued to fall, with healthy demand at a 20-year bond auction adding fuel to the rally.\\nThe debate as to whether inflation is peaking continues but is unlikely to deter central banks from tightening monetary policy, with commodity shortages due to the war in Ukraine keeping prices elevated.\\nA case in point, New Zealand’s consumer price index (CPI), which grew at the fastest pace in 32 years. The CPI grew 6.9% year-on-year and 1.8% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2022.\\nMeanwhile, U.S. 10 year real yields briefly turned positive on Wednesday for the first time since March 2020.

       "203  (Bloomberg) -- Chinese stock traders are losing enthusiasm over hopes of a rebound, key market data show, as policy stimulus falls short of expectation while the economy remains mired in a Covid Zero trap.   \\nThe CSI 300 Index has erased most of its mid-March rally triggered by a sweeping set of policy promises to stabilize markets. The gauge is now just 2.2% above its March 15 close, when a historic rout pushed the benchmark to the lowest since June 2020. \\nInvestors who had expected authorities to ramp up monetary stimulus have since been underwhelmed, with Wednesday’s decision by Chinese banks to keep lending rates unchanged serving as the latest disappointment. Lockdowns in major cities across the country coupled with capital outflow risks as the Federal Reserve hikes rates have also dampened sentiment. \\nRead: China’s Commitment to Covid-Zero Undermines Support for Market\\nHere are three charts that highlight investor caution over China’s onshore equities market:\\nFalling Leverage\\nThe amount of outstanding margin financing dropped for nine consecutive sessions on Tuesday, the longest streak of declines since January. Falling demand for leveraged trade indicates sluggish risk appetite. History suggests stock leverage demand tends to rise alongside a market rebound.\\n“Matters have taken a turn for the worse with the latest round of the Covid-19 resurgence that has led to lockdowns of key economic hubs,” BofA Securities Inc. strategists led by Ritesh Samadhiya wrote in a note this week. “A significant ramp up in policy easing is paramount in attaining the ‘about 5.5%’ growth target.”\\nFleeing Foreigners\\nOverseas investors are pulling money from mainland shares as lockdowns amplify growth risks and the yuan’s weakness against the dollar falls to multi-month lows. Foreigners offloaded 45 billion yuan ($7 billion) of shares onshore through the stock connect in March, the most in two years. Net outflows amounted to 6 billion yuan so far this month through Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \\nREAD: IMF Says China’s Outflows Show Deepening Divergence With U.S.\\nDwindling Trading\\nDaily turnover on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges dipped below 800 billion yuan earlier this week, marking the lowest level since May last year. The slump underscores investor caution as China sticks to its strict Covid Zero approach. Decreasing trading turnover in a down-trending market could indicate a short-term bottom, at least according to past occurrences, though investors say a meaningful rebound is unlikely barring a shift in Covid policy.  \\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "208  By Svea Herbst-Bayliss\\nBOSTON (Reuters) -T. Rowe Price Associates, one of the biggest investors in Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), said it plans to back all of the department store's directors, dealing a setback to activist hedge fund Macellum Advisors as it tries to take control of the board. \\n\"We intend to vote FOR the 13 nominees presented by the Kohl’s board. We do not intend vote on the Macellum card,\\nand we will not support any of its 10 nominees,\" T. Rowe Price said in a case study about how it intends to vote. \\nInvestors will be able to vote at the May 11 meeting. T. Rowe Price owned 6.8 million shares or 5.29% of the company at the end of December. \\nMacellum, led by Jonathan Duskin, has accused Kohl's of not doing enough to improve its business. The fund called for the company to put itself up for sale, which it is now doing by reviewing potential bidders. \\nThe battle for control of Kohl's boardroom has become one of this year's most contentious proxy battles and occurs as the company is reviewing bids from potential buyers. \\nLast week Franchise Group (NASDAQ:FRG) Inc, owner and operator of retail stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Buddy's Home Furnishings, entered the bidding with a $9 billion indicative offer.\\n\\nKohl's has said that its investment bankers have held conversations with more than 20 potential buyers in the last months. \\nThis is also the second time in two years that Macellum has pushed for changes at Kohl's. It sought to replace nine board directors last year in a campaign conducted with hedge funds Ancora Holdings Inc and Legion Partners Asset Management LLC. The investors agreed to drop that challenge when Kohl's expanded the size of its board by three directors. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "211  (Reuters) -BHP Group on Thursday fell short of estimates for iron ore production for the March quarter, as a pandemic-related labour crunch weighed on the miner's efforts to boost production in the mineral-rich Pilbara region of Western Australia. \\nThe world's largest listed miner warned June-quarter production of the steel-making commodity is also expected to be impacted by lingering worker absenteeism, but said it remained on track to meet fiscal 2022 costs and volume forecast. \\nCopper production at BHP's massive Escondida copper mine in Chile declined 9% to 226.4 thousand tonnes (kt) in the third quarter, primarily due to a reduced workforce from COVID-19 quarantine regulations and public road blockades that affected access to the site for both workers and supplies. \\nFiscal 2022 production guidance for the metal was cut to between 1,000 kt and 1,030 kt, from 1,020 and 1,080 kt.\\nIron ore production from Western Australia came in at 66.7 million tonnes (Mt) for the period, flat from a year earlier but lower than a consensus estimate of 70 mt compiled by Visible Alpha.\\nNot until early March did Western Australia lift hard-line border restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic. The measures have left miners struggling to hire mine workers and train drivers even as pent-up demand fuelled a rally in commodity prices.\\nRival Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected iron ore shipments for the three months to March end and warned of risks from sustained high inflation, a resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war.\\n\\nBHP Chief Executive Mike Henry also said market volatility and inflationary pressures have increased further due to the Ukraine crisis. \\nWhile conditions are expected to improve during the course of the 2023 calendar year, we anticipate the skills shortages and overall labour market tightness in Australia and Chile to continue in the period ahead, he said.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Unions are also organizing Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) retail employees for the first time. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Amazon, further behind, aims to launch its first two prototype satellites in late 2022. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "220  Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s plans to get tough on account sharing failed to reassure Wall Street that the world's largest streaming video company had found a way to spark new growth.\\nThe company's stock was down 36% in trading Wednesday, a day after Netflix said it would ask subscribers who share their accounts with people outside of their households to pay more. It blamed password sharing, in part, for failing to hit its subscriber growth targets.\\nThe extent of the shared accounts -- estimated at 100 million around the world, including 30 million in the United States and Canada -- was a warning sign of its own.\\nMedia analyst Michael Nathanson wrote that the crackdown on password sharing signals Netflix thinks it's \"hitting a wall\" at 221.6 million subscribers. \"Any company with large out-year subscriber and (revenue) targets should be a bit more nervous today,\" he wrote.\\nNetflix Chief Operating Officer Gregory Peters on Tuesday told investors the company would not stop a subscriber sharing with a sister. \"But we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her and so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing.\"\\nNetflix has been working on the issue for two years and conducting tests. In March, Netflix began charging users in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru an additional fee to share their accounts with up to two people. On Tuesday, the company said it plans to introduce the new charge for password sharing globally, within a year. \\nSome analysts were skeptical.\\n\"We don’t believe that this strategy will be the panacea that some investors have outlined over the last few years,\" said Morningstar analyst Neil Macker. \"Netflix may be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of some of the primary households, but we think that other ones will look at the new sharing fee as another pricing increase and cancel.\"\\n\\nOthers simply scoffed at the notion that password sharing accounted for Netflix's loss of 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter and predictions that it would lose even more members in the spring.\\n\"It seems more like an excuse for the poor performance than anything else,\" said Manuel Muhl, an analyst with DZ Bank AG. \"Password sharing has been a problem for years, this cannot be cited as a valid reason for disappointing user growth.\" \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "225  seek to challenge, and in certain instances, seek to tear down and even destroy,\" he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\\nAnalysts note that this is the first time China has argued for \"indivisible security\" outside the context of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, with implications on U.S. actions in Asia.\\n\"If China deems actions by U.S. and its allies on Taiwan or the South China Sea as disregarding its security concerns, it could evoke the concept of 'indivisible security' to claim the moral high ground in retaliation,\" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\\nXi also reiterated China's opposition to unilateral sanctions and \"long-arm jurisdiction\", without directly mentioning the West's punitive actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\\nChina has repeatedly criticised Western sanctions, including those against Russia, but it has also been careful not to provide assistance to Moscow that could lead to sanctions being imposed on Beijing.\\nXi said efforts are needed to stabilise global supply chains, but also said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed.\\n\\nJude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Xi's speech was likely an attempt to project existing elements of Beijing's foreign policy as solutions to current global instability.\\n\"I don't see how new architecture could be built around this, so I think instead this is an attempt to weave China's world view into the fabric of international security discourse,\" Blanchette said.\\n \\n

       "226  Republicans in Florida's House on Thursday approved a new congressional map backed by Governor Ron DeSantis that gives the party a major advantage in November's elections while eliminating two majority-Black districts.\\nAfter passage by the state Senate on Wednesday, the new district boundaries only await DeSantis' signature to go into effect. \\nThe House vote came soon after Black lawmakers disrupted the proceedings by staging a sit-in protest. During debate on the proposed map, Black Democrats joined by white colleagues sat on the floor and sang the civil rights anthem \"We Shall Overcome,\" forcing the Republican House Speaker Chris Sprowls to call a recess.\\n\"We cannot allow the elimination of Black representation. This is a direct attack on democracy,\" said Representative Angie Nixon, a Democrat, as she live-streamed the protest while wearing a T-shirt that read \"Stop the Black Attack.\"\\nSeveral Republicans attacked Democrats, whom they said were obstructing legislative business.\\n\"I hope the insurrection on the House Floor is dealt with appropriately. #LockThemUp,\" Republican Representative Randy Fine wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).\\nRepublicans eventually returned to the floor and approved the map on a 68-38 party-line vote even as Democrats shouted objections. \\nVoting rights groups are expected to challenge the map in court as an illegal racial and partisan gerrymander after DeSantis signs it into law.\\nThe governor, who is seen as a top Republican contender for the 2024 presidential campaign, had previously vetoed a map drawn by Republican lawmakers and ordered the legislature into special session this week to consider his administration's proposal.\\nWith all but two other states finished with the once-a-decade redistricting process, the outcome in Florida could play a major role in determining control of Congress.\\n\\nDeSantis' map would likely give Republicans 20 of the state's 28 districts, four more than they currently hold. Republicans need to flip five seats nationally to take the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, which would allow them to block much of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.\\nAdvocates have said the plan violates the law by reducing the number of Black districts from four to two. DeSantis has argued that the map is \"race neutral\" and that the current map is racially gerrymandered in an unconstitutional way. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "232  A lawyer for Alec Baldwin said on Thursday that an investigation by New Mexico has cleared his client of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting on the set of \"Rust,\" pointing out that its report stated the actor believed his gun held only dummy rounds.\\nNew Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau on Wednesday released the findings of a six-month investigation of the shooting during the filming of the Western movie last October. It blasted Rust Movie Productions LLC for \"willful\" safety lapses leading to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and fined the company $137,000, the maximum amount possible.\\nIn response to the findings, Baldwin's attorneys said in a statement that his authority on the production was limited to approving script changes and creative casting and that he had no authority over matters that were subject to the investigation. \\n\"We appreciate that the report exonerates Mr. Baldwin by making clear that he believed the gun held only dummy rounds,\" the statement posted on Baldwin's Instagram account said. \"We are pleased that the New Mexico officials have clarified these critical issues.\"\\nThe agency was not immediately available to comment on the statement. \\nHutchins was killed during a rehearsal when a revolver that Baldwin was holding fired a live round that passed through her and struck the movie's director Joel Souza in the shoulder, wounding him.\\nThe investigation found the production firm had been aware that firearm safety procedures were not being followed and demonstrated \"plain indifference\" to the hazards, the New Mexico Environment Department said in a statement. \\nRust Movie Productions spokesman Stefan Friedman said in a statement on Wednesday that the company disagreed with the findings and planned to appeal. \\nThe probe found that Rust management ignored concerns raised by crew members about firearm and pyrotechnics misfires on set. \\n\\nThe report said Rust management failed to give staff responsible for firearms safety sufficient time to inspect ammunition received to ensure no live rounds were present.\\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Fe County District Attorney have ongoing criminal

       "236  India's Supreme Court will soon rule on whether the demolition of shops in a residential area on the outskirts of New Delhi is legal but, for Mohammed Akbar, whatever decision it makes will come too late.\\nAuthorities say they want to remove illegal stores in Jahangirpuri, where clashes broke out between Muslims and Hindus over the weekend near a mosque and temple in which several people, including police officers, were injured.\\nAs the bulldozers moved in on Wednesday, India's highest court intervened to stop them, but not before Akbar's shop selling cigarettes and cold drinks was destroyed.\\n\"They took my only source of earning. How will I feed my children?\" the father-of-three asked. \"I have loans to pay and how will I pay for clothes for children for Eid?\" added Akbar, whose daily earnings are less than $5.\\nHe, along with some other Muslims in the area, suspect that authorities are punishing those they blame for recent communal violence. Akbar, who said he was not involved in the clashes, has had his small shop in Jahangirpuri for the past 20 years.\\nResidents said fighting broke out on Saturday when a crowd of Hindu worshippers, some carrying sticks and knives, moved through the area during a Hindu religious festival. At least 20 people were arrested. \\nSimilar clashes in other parts of India have been followed by demolition drives, which critics say are an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to intimidate India's 200 million Muslims.\\nVinit Goenka, a BJP spokesman, said the demolitions were not related to religion or retribution.\\n\"Indian criminal procedure code deals with rioters and municipal law deals with illegal structures and illegal construction,\" he said, when asked about the criticism. \"When implementing the law, name and religion is never asked.\"\\nGoenka added that people who attacked peaceful celebrations should be punished.\\n\"A message has to be sent to rioters as prescribed in law, irrespective of his language, community, religion or belief.\"\\nThe Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Delhi responsible for overseeing the demolitions, which target buildings that authorities say encroach on to roads and pathways, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n'JUSTICE FOR ALL'\\nHundreds of police in riot gear armed with batons, guns and tear gas canisters were deployed on Wednesday morning in the area before the drive to remove illegal structures.\\nAfter intervening on Wednesday, the country's top court on Thursday asked authorities to halt demolitions until further notice. The Jahangirpuri case will be heard in two weeks.\\nHome to scores of low-income families, some residents of the area in northwest Delhi complained that the heavy security presence made it hard for them to worship freely during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\\n\"We have been locked in our alleys for the past four days.

       "240  U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil a new strategy for dealing with drug addiction and overdoses on Thursday that aims to expand access to medications for opioid overdoses, increase funding for law enforcement, and expand sanctions against traffickers.\\nThe Biden administration is keen to show it is taking action on a worsening U.S. opioid crisis, which fueled more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\\n\"That's an American life lost every five minutes around the clock,\" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House.\\n\"For too many years, the overdose crisis has been unraveling the very social fabric of our nation and destroying American lives and livelihoods,\" Gupta told reporters on a press call.\\nThe National Drug Control Strategy, which Biden will send to Congress on Thursday, seeks to double treatment admissions for populations that are most at risk of overdose deaths and ensure universal access to medications for opioid use disorder by 2025.\\nCurrently, key tools like naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, and syringe service programs are often restricted or underfunded. There are legal barriers limiting access to naloxone in some states, and even in others the drug is not always available to those most at risk of an overdose.\\nPatients are more likely to receive a naloxone prescription if they had a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence along with an overdose compared with individuals who had those diagnoses without an overdose.\\n\\nThe administration also aims to triple the number of drug traffickers it sanctions and increase border security, said Gupta. Biden in December signed two executive orders aimed at fighting drug trafficking and criminal networks.\\nOne order allowed for new sanctions on Chinese companies trading ingredients of the opioid drug fentanyl and on criminal gangs in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "242  By Kanishka Singh and David Shepardson\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -A security scare at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday prompted evacuation of Congress after a small airplane from the U.S. Army's Golden Knights parachute demonstration team flew over a baseball game, police said.\\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi called the alarm an \"outrageous and frightening mistake\" by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for its failure to alert Capitol Police to the pre-planned performance over the Washington Nationals baseball stadium.\\nShe said Congress would examine the results of a review into the incident to determine what went wrong.\\nThe U.S. Capitol Police first said they were tracking an aircraft that posed a \"probable threat\" to the Capitol complex, and then minutes later said there was no threat and that the building had been evacuated out of an abundance of caution. \\nPolice later said the plane was a military aircraft carrying members of the U.S. Army's Golden Knights parachute demonstration team. The FAA did not notify police in advance about the approved military flight for military appreciation night at Nationals Stadium, Capitol police told congressional staff in a letter.\\nThe FAA said late Wednesday it would \"conduct a thorough and expeditious review of the events this evening and share updates. We know our actions affect others, especially in our nation's capital region, and we must communicate early and often with our law enforcement partners.\"\\nThe FAA statement did not say whether the agency had alerted Capitol Police to the flight, which took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\\nThe Golden Knights parachuted into the Washington Nationals' baseball stadium, Nationals Park, a little over a mile away from the U.S. Capitol, before returning to the Maryland base.\\n\"The unnecessary panic caused by this apparent negligence was particularly harmful for members, staff and institutional workers still grappling with the trauma of the attack on their workplace on January 6th,\" Pelosi said in a statement late on Wednesday, referring to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\n\"Congress looks forward to reviewing the results of a thorough after-action review that determines what precisely went wrong today and who at the Federal Aviation Administration will be held accountable for this outrageous and frightening mistake,\" Pelosi said.\\nCapitol Police said in the email to some congressional staff that it \"will be working with our airspace partners to address the notification issues.\"\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "245  By Jonathan Allen\\n(Reuters) -South Carolina's Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of a condemned man planned for next week that would have been the first firing-squad execution in the United States in more than a decade.\\nRichard Moore, 57, was convicted in 2001 of murdering a store clerk in a 1999 robbery. The jury voted to recommend he be sentenced to death.\\nSouth Carolina's highest court agreed to Moore's request to stay his execution date, set earlier this month for April 29, because of his ongoing legal challenges to his sentence and to the Southern state's execution methods.\\nThe court's order, which was signed by all five justices, did not state the grounds for the stay, but said \"a more detailed order\" would soon follow. A spokesperson for the state's Department of Corrections said the department was awaiting the fuller order before commenting.\\nSeveral state governments and the federal government have struggled in recent years to obtain lethal-injection drugs, in part because pharmaceutical companies generally forbid the sale of their medicines for use in executions. \\nAs a result, execution officials have had to substitute those specific drugs with more easily obtained ones or revive older execution methods, such as gas asphyxiation or the electric chair. The new or revised execution protocols have drawn an array of legal challenges from people on death rows across the country, bolstered by a number of ghastly \"botched\" executions by lethal injection. \\nMoore and other death row inmates who are suing the South Carolina Department of Corrections in a lower-level state court say the execution methods available to them violate the South Carolina constitution, which forbids cruel or unusual punishments. Unlike the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment, the state's constitution explicitly forbids corporal punishment.\\nSouth Carolina last carried out an execution in 2011, using lethal injection. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a law in 2021 making electrocution the state's main method of execution, and added a firing squad as an option.\\nEarlier this month, the Department of Corrections asked Moore to choose either to be killed by electric chair or by a firing squad after telling him that execution officials were unable to secure lethal-injection drugs.\\nLast week, Moore chose a firing squad, a method that has been used only three times in the United States since 1950, and is viewed by some as a quicker, more painless and less easily botched death, if harder for witnesses to watch.\\nThose three firing squad executions were all carried out by the state of Utah -- in 1977, 1996 and 2010 -- according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.\\n\"I do not believe or concede that either the firing squad or electrocution is legal or constitutional,\" Moore said in a statement informing the Department of Corrections of his choice. He said that if he refused to make a choice, the department had said it would default to the electric chair.\\n\\nLindsey Vann, a lawyer for Moore, said she was glad the state Supreme Court was \"allowing for more time\" for Moore's cases to be reviewed.\\nMoore also sought the stay to allow him to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to find the death penalty excessive in his case. His lawyers have argued that because he entered the store unarmed and used the clerk's own gun after grabbing it in a scuffle, that the murder was not premeditated.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "
